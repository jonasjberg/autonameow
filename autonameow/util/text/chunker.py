class TextChunker(object):
    def __init__(self, text, chunk_to_text_ratio):
        """
        Splits multi-line text into smaller chunks.

        Example usage:

            chunker = _get_text_chunker('A\nB\nC\nD\nE\n', 0.5)
            assert chunker[0] == 'A\nB\n'
            assert chunker[1] == 'C\n'
            assert chunker[2] == 'D\nE\n'
            assert chunker.leading == 'A\nB\n'
            assert chunker.trailing == 'D\nE\n'
            assert len(chunker) == 3

        The chunk sizes (number of text lines in each chunk) is calculated from
        the chunk to text ratio as CHUNK_SIZE = LINES_IN_TEXT * CHUNK_RATIO

        The number of lines in the first and last chunks should match the chunk
        size exactly, while the number of lines in the center chunks might vary
        a bit so that the total number of chunks is more predictable.

        Args:
            text: Text to split into chunks, as either str or bytes.
            chunk_to_text_ratio: Size of the chunks as a float between 0 and 1.
