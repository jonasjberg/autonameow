TODO(jonas): Running "from ebooklib import epub" currently FAILS on MacOS!

________________________________________________________________________________
FAILURE on MacOS!
This is caused by ebooklib running "from lxml import etree" which fails
because the only "etree" file that is vendored must be compiled ..

Temporary fix:

* Disable the vendored package by renaming the directory:

    mv -nv -- '${SOURCEROOT}/autonameow/vendor/lxml{,_DISABLED}'

Activate a autonameow virtualenv:

    source env/bin/activate

Install "lxml" with pip inside the virtualenv:

    pip3 install lxml==4.2.5

Verify that the installed package is used:

    PYTHONPATH=autonameow/vendor python3 -c "from ebooklib import epub ; print(epub.__file__)"
    resulting stdout: ${SOURCEROOT}/autonameow/vendor/ebooklib/epub.py

    PYTHONPATH=autonameow/vendor python3 -c "from lxml import etree ; print(etree.__file__)"
    resulting stdout: ${SOURCEROOT}/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/lxml/etree.cpython-37m-darwin.so

The 'lxml' package was extracted from
'lxml-4.2.5-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl', which was downloaded with:

    $ STATIC_DEPS=true pip3 install lxml --download .

And then extracted by doing something like:

    $ unzip lxml-4.2.5-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
