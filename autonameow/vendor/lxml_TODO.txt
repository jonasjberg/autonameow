TODO(jonas): Handle this better and use the compiled Cython version.


The 'lxml' package was extracted from
'lxml-4.2.5-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl', which was downloaded with:

    $ STATIC_DEPS=true pip3 install lxml --download .

And then extracted by doing something like:

    $ unzip lxml-4.2.5-cp35-cp35m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
