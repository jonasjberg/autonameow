# Benefits of encapsulating a field/value tuple in a 'Field' class
# ================================================================
# Cases where there are fields that should have a single value,
# I.E. not 'multivalued'.
# Storing metadata in dicts keyed by fields does not handle this well;
#
#     metadata = {
#         'XMP:ModifyDate': [1942, 2018]
#     }
#
# Passing this to 'coerce_field_value' would result in either skipping the
# value because the field meta specifies that a single value is expected
# *OR* coercing the list into a single value, maybe by only using the first
# (1942) or maybe joining them into a single string ('1942 2018') ..
#
# Either way is not what we want. Would probably rather store two separate
# instances, __which isn't possible__ when storing in dicts keyed by the field!
#
# Workarounds like this will NOT work for obvious reasons..
#
#     metadata = {
#         'XMP:ModifyDate_A': 1942,
#         'XMP:ModifyDate_B': 2018
#     }
#
# HOWEVER, this could be worked around by encapsulating the field name and
# value in an instance of a 'Field' class that uses both the field name and value
# to calculate the hash used by dicts;
#
#     metadata = [
#         Field('XMP:ModifyDate', 1942),
#         Field('XMP:ModifyDate', 2018)
#     ]
#
# And to avoid having to iterate over lists to check for membership, etc.,
# a collection of fields could be bundled with instances of a 'Record' class;
#
#     metadata = Record(
#         Field('XMP:ModifyDate', 1942),
#         Field('XMP:ModifyDate', 2018)
#     )
#
# Alternatively, to indicate these are mutually exclusive *possible* values;
#
#     metadata = [
#         Record(
#             Field('XMP:ModifyDate', 1942),
#         ),
#         Record(
#             Field('XMP:ModifyDate', 2018)
#         )
#     ]
