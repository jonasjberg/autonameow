# NOTE(jonas): Pass only Unicode strings to the UI.


# This package is intended to be the interface to multiple containing
# subpackages that each implement different UIs.
#
# There is currently only a command-line interface, so this interface
# does not exist. BUT it might be good to implement the interface only once
# another UI is added and the real use and requirements are clearer anyway.
#
# For now, most of the core code should strive to call 'view.msg()' instead of
# using 'view.cli.msg()' directly, even if future addition of an alternative
# 'msg()' implementation will require massive rework..

# TODO: [TD0111] Separate abstract user interaction from UI specifics.
