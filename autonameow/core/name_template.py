# TODO: [TD0049]` Think about defining legal "placeholder fields".
# Might be helpful to define all legal fields (such as `title`, `datetime`,
# `author`, etc.) somewhere and keep references to type coercion wrappers,
# maybe validation and/or formatting functionality; in the field definitions.
#
# NOTE(jonas): This should probably be done where both the Extraction data and
# the Analysis results data is "joined"; the sum total of data available for a
# given file.
