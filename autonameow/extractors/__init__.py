class BaseExtractor(object):
    """
    Top-level abstract base class for all filetype-specific extractor classes.

    Includes common functionality and interfaces that must be implemented
    by inheriting extractor classes.

    All "extractors" must inherit from the 'BaseExtractor' class. This class
    is never used directly -- it is an abstract class that defines interfaces
    that must be implemented by inheriting classes.

    Currently, there is also an additional layer of abstraction/inheritance/
    (indirection..) between the 'BaseExtractor' and the *actual *REAL**
    extractor classes that are used at runtime.

    Current inheritance hierarchy:

        (abstract)  @ BaseExtractor
                    |
        (abstract)  +--* AbstractTextExtractor
                    |  |
                    |  +--* ImageOCRTextExtractor
                    |  '--* PdfTextExtractor
                    |
        (abstract)  '--* AbstractMetadataExtractor
                       |
                       +--* ExiftoolMetadataExtractor
                       '--* PyPDFMetadataExtractor

    The abstract extractors defines additional interfaces, extending the base.
    It is pretty messy and should be redesigned and simplified at some point ..
