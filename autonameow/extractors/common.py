class BaseExtractor(object):
    """
    Top-level abstract base class for all filetype-specific extractor classes.

    Includes common functionality and interfaces that must be implemented
    by inheriting extractor classes.

    All "extractors" must inherit from the 'BaseExtractor' class. This class
    is abstract and serves to define interfaces that actual extractor classes
    must implement --- it is never used directly.

    Currently, there is also an additional layer of abstraction/inheritance/
    (indirection..) between the 'BaseExtractor' and the *actual *REAL**
    extractor classes that are used at runtime.

    Current inheritance hierarchy:

        (abstract)  @ BaseExtractor
                    |
        (abstract)  +--* AbstractTextExtractor
                    |  |
                    |  +--* ImageOCRTextExtractor
                    |  '--* PdfTextExtractor
                    |
        (abstract)  '--* AbstractMetadataExtractor
                       |
                       +--* ExiftoolMetadataExtractor
                       '--* PyPDFMetadataExtractor

    The abstract extractors defines additional interfaces, extending the base.
    It is pretty messy and should be redesigned and simplified at some point ..
