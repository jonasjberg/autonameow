# Analysis relevant to all files, regardless of file mime type.
# Examines:
#   * file names
#   * file system metadata (modified, created, ..)


# TODO: Check file name
#       Basically a bunch of regexes matching preset patterns:
#       * date-/timestamp
#       * incrementer (file ends with a number)
