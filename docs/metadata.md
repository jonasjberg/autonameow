Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Version 1.1
--------------------------------------------

The original [__Dublin Core Metadata Element Set__][4] consists of 15 metadata elements:

1. Title
2. Creator
3. Subject
4. Description
5. Publisher
6. Contributor
7. Date
8. Type
9. Format
10. Identifier
11. Source
12. Language
13. Relation
14. Coverage
15. Rights

Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has
established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding
and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for
presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became ISO 15836 standard in
2006 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of
learning resources in the [ISO/IEC 19788][1]-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR)
â€“ Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the [ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36][2].

Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in
the [Dublin Core Metadata Registry][15].
