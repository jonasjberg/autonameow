===============================
Notes on projects similar/related to automatic naming of files,
extracting/parsing metadata, etc.



`hachoir-metadata`
------------------
hachoir-metadata extracts metadata from multimedia files: music, picture,
video, but also archives.

* Sources: <http://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/wiki/hachoir-metadata>

It tries to give as much information as possible. For some file formats, it
gives more information than libextractor for example, such as the RIFF parser,
which can extract creation date, software used to generate the file, etc. But
hachoir-metadata cannot guess informations. The most complex operation is just
to compute duration of a music using frame size and file size.


`metagoofil`
------------
Metagoofil is an information gathering tool designed for extracting metadata of
public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,docx,pptx,xlsx) belonging to a target
company.

* Sources: <https://code.google.com/archive/p/metagoofil/>

The tool will perform a search in Google to identify and download the documents
to local disk and then will extract the metadata with different libraries like
Hachoir, PdfMiner and others. With the results it will generate a report with
usernames, software versions and servers or machine names that will help
Penetration testers in the information gathering phase.


`GNU Libextractor`
------------------
* Website: <https://www.gnu.org/software/libextractor/>
* Sources: <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libextractor/>

GNU Libextractor is a library used to extract meta data from files.
The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks, browsers or
WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain simple keywords and meta
data to match against queries and to show to users instead of only relying on
filenames.

libextractor contains the shell command `extract` that, similar to the
well-known `file` command, can extract meta data from a file an print the
results to stdout.

episodes.

> tables) from unstructured information (text documents) and integrating such
> data with an existing structured database. DeepDive is used to extract
> sophisticated relationships between entities and make inferences about facts
> involving those entities. DeepDive helps one process a wide variety of dark
> data and put the results into a database. With the data in a database, one can
> use a variety of standard tools that consume structured data; e.g.,
> visualization tools like Tableau or analytics tools like Excel.
