### guessfilename.py
<https://github.com/novoid/guess-filename.py>
Tries to come up with a new file name for each file from command line argument.


Part of a very interesting and very well thought out system, similar to what I
want to accomplish. I have already stolen a lot of ideas from [this blog][1],
starting when I found [this post][2] a couple of years ago.


### tvnamer
<https://github.com/dbr/tvnamer>
tvnamer is a utility which to rename files from 
`some.show.s01e03.blah.abc.avi` to `Some Show - [01x03] - The Episode Name.avi`
(by retrieving the episode name using data from tvdb_api)


Similar functionality and overall idea of automated renaming.


### beets
<https://github.com/beetbox/beets>
Beets is the media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music geeks.
The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for all. It
catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata as it goes. It
then provides a bouquet of tools for manipulating and accessing your music.


I use this myself and it does work well for automatically restructuring a music
collection.
