  USAGE:  ${SELF} [PATH TO PYTHON PROGRAM]

  Lists modules imported by the specified Python program.
  Imports used by a simple "no-op" program is used to filter the
  listing.  The idea is to get rid of default standard libraries.

  NOTE:  This method *might* be thoroughly unsound and misguided.
