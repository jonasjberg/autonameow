# Very simple and likely broken search of unused functions and methods.
# First finds all 'def DEF_NAME' in Python source files. These files are
# then searched again for anything matching; "DEF_NAME("  or  "=DEF_NAME"
# which is counted as one "usage" of 'DEF_NAME'.
#
# This script does not yield very good results but can help with finding
# methods or functions that are only used by their tests.
# PyCharm and "vulture" probably also have some kind of functionality to
# ignore usage by test code, but I haven't found it yet..
#
# NOTE: Make sure working directory is "AUTONAMEOW_ROOT_DIRPATH/autonameow"
