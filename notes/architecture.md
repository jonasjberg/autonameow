Rethinking Requests and Gathering Required Data
===============================================
Currently, either all extractors are executed when "listing all results" or
only extractors that are "mapped" to MeowURIs that are referenced in the active
configuration are executed.

For performance and implementing coming features like evaluating conditions
like *"does the textual contents match this regular expression?"*, it would
probably make more sense to rethink data extraction to something more like
"streaming" and non-blocking/request-based;
__gathering only the data that is explicitly required.__

When evaluating a rule like;

> * Conditions:
>     1. MIME-type is `image/jpeg`
>     2. Textual contents match `meow*`
>
> * Exact match is required

Given a file `foo.pdf`, the first condition will fail and because the rule
requires all conditions to evaluate true, the entire rule should be discarded.

Rule evaluation should be aborted after the first failed condition, there is no
need to extract textual contents.


"Streaming" or "On-demand" Extraction
-------------------------------------
Example of rule evaluation using this proposed re-design, using a configuration;

> 1. Rule 1
>     * Conditions:
>         1. MIME-type is `image/jpeg`
>         2. Textual contents match `meow*`
>     * Exact match is required
> 2. Rule 2
>     * Conditions:
>         1. MIME-type is `application/*`
>         2. Textual contents match `meow*`
>     * Exact match is required

Rule evaluation would follow something like the following sequence of events.

* Given a file `foo.pdf`;
    * __Start evaluating Rule 1__
        * Start evaluating condition 1
            * Get data (MIME-type) required to evaluate condition 1
                * Execute extractor that can provide the required data.
            * Evaluate condition 1:  `application/pdf == image/jpeg`
            * Condition evaluates FALSE
    * __Discard Rule 1__
    * __Start evaluating Rule 2__
        * Start evaluating condition 1
            * Get __previously extracted data__ (MIME-type)
            * Evaluate condition 1:  `application/pdf == application/*`
            * Condition evaluates TRUE
        * Start evaluating condition 2
            * Extract data (textual contents) required to evaluate condition 2
                * Execute extractor that can provide the required data.
            * Evaluate condition 2:  `text.matches(meow*)`
            * Condition evaluates FALSE
    * __Discard Rule 2__ *(assuming the text does not match `meow*`)*

* Given a file `foo_bar.jpg`;
    * __Start evaluating Rule 1__
        * Start evaluating condition 1
            * Get data (MIME-type) required to evaluate condition 1
                * Execute extractor that can provide the required data.
            * Evaluate condition 1:  `image/jpeg == image/jpeg`
            * Condition evaluates TRUE.
        * Start evaluating condition 2
            * Extract data (textual contents) required to evaluate condition 2
                * Execute extractor that can provide the required data.
            * Evaluate condition 2:  `text.matches(meow*)`
            * Condition evaluates FALSE.
    * __Start evaluating Rule 2__
        * Start evaluating condition 1
            * Get __previously extracted data__ (MIME-type)
            * Evaluate condition 1:  `image/jpeg == application/*`
            * Condition evaluates FALSE.
    * __Discard Rule 2__


### Take-away Points

* Avoid preemptively extracting data that is not explicitly required.
* Re-use data that has been extracted previously.
* Instead of running extraction and rule evaluation as completely separate
  processes, gather data "on demand".


### Practical Concerns
If a rule condition requires a single piece of data, say `EXIF:CreateDate`, it
makes no sense to start the relevant provider (`exiftool`) and store *only this
single field* and discard the other metadata.  Rather, some requests for data
might make more data available as a side-effect if doing so results in a faster
overall execution time.


Modular Design
==============
Roughly all program components generally fall under either one of two
categories; __core__ or __non-core__.

The idea is that the __non-core__-components should be "pluggable" and
"hotloaded" depending on availability and suitability.

It should be easy to add functionality and custom behavior to the program,
communication between the *core* and *non-core* components should follow some
well-defined interface to allow the *core* to change without affecting the
*non-core* components.


Following a Sample Program Invocation
=====================================
The program will act on one or many files at once. The following processing
pipeline is executed for each given file.

Once again, with additional implementation details (some of which is still
unimplemented..) included:

1. Receive `input_path(s)` to process
    1. Find files to process, recursively if using `-r`/`--recurse`

2. Start iterating over the files in the list of files to process
   --- for each file, do;
    1. Construct a `FileObject` representing the file
    2. __Begin "data extraction"__
        1. Gather all extractor classes that "can handle" the file,
           which is determined by testing the file MIME-type.
        2. If all results should be displayed, include all extractors.
           Otherwise, of the extractors that have the `is_slow` flag set,
           include only those referenced by the active configuration rules.
        3. Call each extractor in turn, passing the results back to the
           `SessionRepository`.
    3. __Begin "analysis"__
        1. Gather all analyzer classes the "can handle" the file,
           determined by the class methods `can_handle`.
        2. Run all analyzers in turn, passing the results back to the
           `SessionRepository`.
    4. __Run "plugins"__
        1. Gather all available plugins.
        2. Filter out plugins that "can handle" the file, determined by the
           class method `can_handle` of each plugin.
        3. Run all plugins in turn, passing the results back to the
           `SessionRepository`.
    5. __Run "rule matcher"__
        1. Get all rules from the active configuration.
        2. For each rule, do;
            1. Evaluate all rule conditions.
            2. Remove rules that require an exact match and any conditions
               evaluates false.
        3. For each remaining rule, do;
            1. Evaluate all rule conditions and calculate scores and weights
               based on the number of met conditions and the total number of
               conditions.
        4. Prioritize rules by score, weight and ranking bias.
        5. Store all prioritized rules as "candidates", presenting the highest
           priority rule as the "best match".
    6. __A) If running in "automagic" mode__
        1. Set the active name template to the name template defined in the
           "best matched" rule.
        2. Create an instance of `Resolver`
        3. Register each of the data sources defined in the "best matched" rule as a
           known source to the resolver.
        4. Check that all name template fields have been assigned a known source.

<!-- TODO: .. -->


On future frontends/GUIs
========================

### What is going on?

* __Program Operates on input:__ file(s)
* __Program Provides:__ New file names for the file(s)

Where/when are options presented and choices made?
Which could be presented in a GUI or in an *interactive mode*?

For any given file, how does the program come up with a new name?

What is required to come up with a new file name?

1. Select a __name template__
2. Populate the __placeholder fields__ in the template


#### Selecting a __name template__

* Chosen by the user
* Determined by the active configuration rule, chosen by the `RuleMatcher`

#### Populating the __placeholder fields__
How are the fields populated?

For each placeholder field, get some data that can be formatted to the fields
requirement (?).
The data could be either;

* Interactively chosen by the user
* Determined by the active configuration rule, chosen by the `RuleMatcher`

Which choices are presented to the user?
How are possible candidates collected?

### Working Backwards ..
.. to figure out where and if to place a "uncertainty boundary".
Which part of the program should only receive the single truth and not lists of
possible alternatives, etc.

Data pipeline in reverse order; working backwards from the final result:

1. __Name Builder__
    * Receives a name template string and a `field_data_map` dict:
        ```python
        field_data_map = {
            <class 'core.namebuilder.fields.Extension'>: <ExtractedData(
                PathComponent,
                mapped_fields=[
                    WeightedMapping(field=<class 'core.namebuilder.fields.Extension'>, probability=1)
                ],
                generic_field=None)(png)>,
            <class 'core.namebuilder.fields.Title'>: <ExtractedData(
                PathComponent,
                mapped_fields=[],
                generic_field=None)(simple-lexical-analysis)>
        }
        ```
      That is passed to `pre_assemble_format()` and then
      `_with_simple_string_keys()`, which turns it into:

        ```python
        data = {
            'extension': 'png',
            'title': 'simple-lexical-analysis'
        }
        ```
      This form is used to populate the name template string.

    * __The name builder should (does) receive unambigous, validated data__

2. __Resolver__
    * Receives the current `FileObject` and a name template string.
    * Generates a list of name template field classes from the name
      template string.
    * Data sources for template fields are added by calls to
      `add_known_sources()`.
    * *TODO: ..*
