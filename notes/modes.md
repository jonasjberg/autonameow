Due to the fact that both `--interactive` and `--batch` has been missing and
completely unimplemented until very recently, any differences between the modes
has not been at all obvious.

The plan has been the same for quite som time. High-level Goals:

* Let the user run the program in different *operating modes*
* Provide different means of controlling and accessing the program core.
* Provide a "hands-off"
