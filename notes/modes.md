Due to the fact that both `--interactive` and `--batch` has been missing and
completely unimplemented until very recently, any differences between the modes
has not been at all obvious.

The plan has been the same for quite som time. High-level Goals:

* __Try to do "the right" thing__

    * Primarily through configuration rules but also hopefully other heuristics
      for finding most suitable candidates, implemented in the "analyzers".

* __Let the user run the program in different *operating modes*__

    * __Non-interactive/"batch"__ --- For scripting and executing as an
      external program from E.G.  file managers, etc.
    * __Interactive__ --- Some kind of user control, primarily a command-line
      interface. *Maybe allow adding on other GUI wrappers in the future?*


Operating Modes
===============


### `--automagic`
Try to rename without user interaction by using the highest ranked
configuration rule.

* __Name Template__ --- If the rule matching does not result in a valid name
  template: __ask the user__.

* __Template Fields__ --- If any name templates fields are not mapped to data
  sources, or the mapped sources are missing or incompatible: __ask the user__.

### `--automagic` and `--batch`
Try to rename without user interaction by using the highest ranked
configuration rule.

* __Name Template__ --- If the rule matching does not result in a valid name
  template: __skip the file__.

* __Template Fields__ --- If any name templates fields are not mapped to data
  sources, or the mapped sources are missing or incompatible: __skip the file__.

### `--interactive`
Leave all choices to the user.

* __Name Template__ --- Ask the user which rule (containing a name template) or
  name template to use.

* __Template Fields__ --- Ask the user which data sources (or rule containing
  data sources) to use.
