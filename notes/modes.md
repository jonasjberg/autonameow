Due to the fact that both `--interactive` and `--batch` has been missing and
completely unimplemented until very recently, any differences between the modes
has not been at all obvious.

The plan has been the same for quite som time. High-level Goals:

* __Try to do "the right" thing__

    * Primarily through configuration rules but also hopefully other heuristics
      for finding most suitable candidates, implemented in the "analyzers".

* __Let the user run the program in different *operating modes*__

    * __Non-interactive/"batch"__ --- For scripting and executing as an
      external program from E.G.  file managers, etc.
    * __Interactive__ --- Some kind of user control, primarily a command-line
      interface. *Maybe allow adding on other GUI wrappers in the future?*


Operating Modes
===============
Initial draft on options and intended interactions.


### `(default)`
Try to rename by using the highest ranked configuration rule.

Ask the user about any uncertainties, warnings, unresolved data, etc.

* __Name Template__ --- If the rule matching does not result in a valid name
  template: __ask the user__.

* __Template Fields__ --- If any name templates fields are not mapped to data
  sources, or the mapped sources are missing or incompatible: __ask the user__.

### `--batch`
Try to rename by using the highest ranked configuration rule.

Do not interact with the user at all.

* __Name Template__ --- If the rule matching does not result in a valid name
  template: __skip the file__.

* __Template Fields__ --- If any name templates fields are not mapped to data
  sources, or the mapped sources are missing or incompatible: __skip the file__.

### `--interactive`
Try to rename by using the highest ranked configuration rule.

Leave all choices to the user.

* __Name Template__ --- Ask the user which rule (containing a name template) or
  name template to use.

* __Template Fields__ --- Ask the user which data sources (or rule containing
  data sources) to use.

### `--automagic`
Try to rename by using the highest ranked configuration rule or any other
available means; "heuristics", etc.

Ask the user about any uncertainties, warnings, unresolved data, etc.

* __Name Template__ --- If the rule matching does not result in a valid name
  template: __ask the user__.

* __Template Fields__ --- If any name templates fields are not mapped to data
  sources, or the mapped sources are missing or incompatible: __ask the user__.

### `--automagic` and `--batch`
Try to rename by using the highest ranked configuration rule or any other
available means; "heuristics", etc.

Do not interact with the user at all.

* __Name Template__ --- If the rule matching does not result in a valid name
  template: __skip the file__.

* __Template Fields__ --- If any name templates fields are not mapped to data
  sources, or the mapped sources are missing or incompatible: __skip the file__.

### `--automagic` and `--interactive`
Try to rename by using the highest ranked configuration rule or any other
available means; "heuristics", etc.

Have the user confirm everything and make all choices.

* __Name Template__ --- Like `--automagic` but have the user confirm everything.
* __Template Fields__ --- Like `--automagic` but have the user confirm everything.


Breakdown of the Operating Modes
================================
Going with the above operating modes, the program modes control two aspects of
program operation; `method` and `user interaction`.


"Method"
--------
The "method" is either based on matching rules or the "automagic" mode which
uses all available means to come up with *something*.

* `(default)` --- Use rule-matching only.
* `--automagic` --- Try everything to come up with *something*.  
  First do rule-matching, then do whatever else.
  Given at least one piece of candidate data per name template field,
  this should not fail.


User Interaction
----------------
The amount of (required) user interaction can be one of three levels;

0. `--batch` --- No user interaction. For scripting, etc.
1. `(default)` --- Ask the user if something cannot be resolved,
   to confirm uncertainties, warnings, etc.
2. `--interactive` --- Ask the user about just about everything.
