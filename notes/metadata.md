Dublin Core Metadata Element Set Version 1.1
--------------------------------------------

The original [__Dublin Core Metadata Element Set__][4] consists of 15 metadata elements:

1. Title
2. Creator
3. Subject
4. Description
5. Publisher
6. Contributor
7. Date
8. Type
9. Format
10. Identifier
11. Source
12. Language
13. Relation
14. Coverage
15. Rights

Each Dublin Core element is optional and may be repeated. The DCMI has
established standard ways to refine elements and encourage the use of encoding
and vocabulary schemes. There is no prescribed order in Dublin Core for
presenting or using the elements. The Dublin Core became ISO 15836 standard in
2006 and is used as a base-level data element set for the description of
learning resources in the [ISO/IEC 19788][1]-2 Metadata for learning resources (MLR)
-- Part 2: Dublin Core elements, prepared by the [ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36][2].

Full information on element definitions and term relationships can be found in
the [Dublin Core Metadata Registry][15].


Unique Identifiers
==================
Rundown of identifiers from [this article][5]:

> Content Identification
> ----------------------
>
> * __ISAN__: The International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISO 15706) is a
>   system for uniquely identifying an asset, independent of the broadcast
>   schedule or recording medium. MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 have a field for ISAN and the
>   SMPTE Metadata dictionary supports ISAN as an identifier/locator. The ISAN has
>   a standardized length as does the ISBN.
>
> * __UMID__: Unlike the ISAN which is intended for the entire work as a unit,
>   UMID Unique Material Identifiers (specified in SMPTE 300M) are used in
>   Material Exchange Format (MXF) and can reference shots and even individual
>   frames. Rather than being issued by an organization, UMIDs can easily be
>   generated by camcorders in a manner similar to the way SMPTE timecodes are
>   generated. Extended UMIDs go beyond identification and encode metadata such as
>   the creation date and time, location and the organization.
>
> * __ISRC__: The International Standard Recording Code, ISO 3901, is used for
>   sound and music video recordings and includes a representation of country of
>   origin, recording entity (record label), year and a 5 digit serial number.
>
> * __CID__: This content identifier originated in Japan and is a product of the
>   Content ID Forum or cIDf. The CID is designed to be embedded within the
>   digital object, typically video or images.
>
> * __CRID__: TV-Anytime defines the Content Reference Identifier or CRID to
>   uniquely identify content independent of its location or instance. It is used
>   for EPG applications. While typically refering to a single program, CRIDs may
>   also refer to groups of programs or segments of programs.
>
> * __ISWC__: The International Standard Musical Work Code, ISO 1507, is intended
>   to uniquely identify a musical work for rights purposes as distinct from the
>   particular recording for which the ISRC is intended.
>
> * __ISMN__: The International Standard Music Number (ISO 10957) can be veiwed as
>   a subset of the ISBN for works related to music such as scores and lyrics.
>
> * __DOI__: Digital Object Idendifier (IDF â€“ International DOI Foundation, the
>   syntax is defined in ANSI/NISO Z39.84) offers a system for persistent
>   identification and management of digital items. The strings are opaque unlike
>   CID, ISRC, etc. Initally designed for text documents.
>
> * __GUID__: Some systems such as RSS support a GUID or Globally Unique
>   Identifier element. In RSS it is an optional string of arbitrary length.RSS
>   will be explained in detail later.
