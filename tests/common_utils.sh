# Runs a "task" (evaluates an expression) and prints messages.
#
# 1. First argument controls message printing and supression of expression
#    output. Everything but 'true' results in passing all output.
# 2. Second argument is a message that describes the task being performed.
#    Message formatting is controlled by the first argument. If 'quiet' is
#    'true', a single line is printed for each task. Otherwise, the same
#    line is printed before running the tasks and then again after.
# 3. Third argument is an arbitrary expression to evalute.
#    If the expression evaluates to 0 the task is considered to have succeeded,
#    any other return code is considered a failure.
