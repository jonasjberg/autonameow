# TODO(jonas): Fix the mocking of print calls! Everything is not caught.
#
# The solution based around the 'MockUI' class handles all direct calls to the
# 'view' methods; HOWEVER, when functions inside the 'view.cli' modules call
# 'print_stdout()' directly it is not handled correctly. This happens when
# calling 'print_version_info()'.
#
# Also, replaceing 'sys.stdout' and 'sys.stderr' in 'regression/utils.py' with
# the line 'with uu.capture_stdout() as stdout, uu.capture_stderr() as stderr:'
# does not catch everything either! It catches some but not all, likely due to
# the order in which imports happen and the fact that the cached version of
# 'sys.stdout', etc., takes precedence due to something like module caching.
#
# stdout:
#     matches:
#     - '^v\d\.\d\.\d$'
