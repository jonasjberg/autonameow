Expect a first rule to fail so that a rule with a constant file name is used.

This should happen even when the second rule does not contain any conditions.

This tests that rules are evaluated and prioritized as expected.
The rule with one data sources should be prioritized higher as it does contain
a single data source and the second rule does not.

First, the rule with a data source is expected to fail
(the data source provided for {author} is __assumed__ to be unavailable)

Second, expect the other rule with a constant file name, I.E. the template does
not contain placeholders, to be used.

Note: Requires the "automagic mode" to be enabled,
      otherwise files are skipped when the first rule fails!
