__`autonameow` does automatic renaming of files__

The primary goal is to reduce the overhead and manual work required to
apply a strict file naming convention uniformly and consistently.



Refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/1dv430/js224eh-project/wiki) for
current project documentation and development status.


See [`docs/install.md`](./docs/install.md) for a *(temporary)* guide to
