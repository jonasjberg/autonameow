--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__`autonameow` does automatic renaming of files__

The primary goal is to reduce the overhead and manual work required to
apply a strict file naming convention uniformly and consistently.

#### PLEASE NOTE
__This software is still in early stages of development --- NOT READY FOR USE!__

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`autonameow` is written for __Python 3.6__, targeting __Linux__ and
__MacOS__.

Support for additional platforms will probably be added at some future time.

~~(Both Android and Windows already seems to work good enough with some
tweaking and/or inconveniences)~~

Don't expect `autonameow` to run on anything but the targeted platforms, for
now.


Installing
----------
If you want to use `autonameow`, __please wait for the first stable release__;
version `v1.0.0`.

Don't feel like waiting?  See [`install.md`](./install.md) for a *(temporary)*
guide to installing under Linux and MacOS.


Running
-------
Use the wrapper script `bin/autonameow.sh` to start `autonameow`.


Documentation
-------------
The wiki is not be updated and does not reflect the current state of the
project. I simply don't have time to keep the documentation in sync with
frequent and non-trivial changes to the software.

The project was for a period of time developed as part of the course
"`1DV430` -- Individual Software Development Project", given at
[Linnaeus University](https://lnu.se/en/) as part of the
"[Software Development and Operations](https://udm-devops.se/)" programme.

The course work began at version `v0.3.0`
([commit](https://github.com/jonasjberg/autonameow/commit/cbe439104813d83ee5a6274eed0943433955b59c))
and ended with version `v0.4.0`
([commit](https://github.com/jonasjberg/autonameow/commit/da494350dca4f99157cc8f7541f92ca8d7f3daf1))

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/jonasjberg/autonameow/wiki) for
