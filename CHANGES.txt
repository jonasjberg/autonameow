2017-07-25  [autonameow v0.4.4]
            Mostly non-functional improvements and refactoring.
            Rework of the internals for improved robustness and new features.

            Additions:
            - Adds a new script 'devscripts/next_todo_id.py'.
              Returns the next free TODO-list identifier that hasn't been used
              in either the TODO-list ('TODO.md') or "done" list ('done.md').
            - Add missing unit tests.
            - First implementation of internal custom type system.
              Custom type "wrapper" classes are used to coerce data into
              certain types. Classes are instantiated and re-used as "filters",
              the data is simply passed through and not contained within the
              custom type classes.
            - Add a method '_normalize' to the 'RegexConfigFieldParser' class.
              To be used for normalizing "unwieldy" text which might hopefully
              make matching more intuitive when dealing with text that "should"
              match but doesn't due to Unicode symbols looking very similar..
              NOTE: Currently completely unused.
            - Add passing extractor results data through the 'Path' type.
              Also adds modifications to the 'FileObject' class to match these
              changes. The 'FileObject' fields that are used in the changed
              lines should already be in the "internal bytestring" format, and
              so passing the data through the 'Path' type class returns them
              as-is.
              However, the idea is that this is part of a overarching change in
              how types are handled throughout the program and this specific
              case might be revisited and simplified at some later stage.
            - Add a partial implementation of handling "raw" data safer.
              Data extracted by 'MetadataExtractor' classes is wrapped in type
              classes that provide validation and type coercion.
              This *might* be a viable way to convert unknown "raw" data to a
              internal representation with greater certainties regarding the
              data types and contents.
              This might also solve formatting and other related issues.
            - Add mapping type wrappers to "raw" data with
              'tagname_type_lookup' in Extractor classes.
            - Add function 'try_wrap' that attempts to wrap values.
              Uses a lookup table dict 'PRIMITIVE_AW_TYPE_MAP' to map the type
              of the given value to internal type wrapper classes.

            Changes:
            - Refactor and cleanup the 'Configuration' class.
            - Rework how parsers are mapped to "query strings".
            - Various refactoring of unit tests.
            - Modify fields for 'DateTimeConfigFieldParser'.
            - Add returning dummy, false-positive "True" incomplete parsers.
              Results in unimplemented field parser evaluation functions will
              always evaluate a condition to True. Uses lambda-functions.
            - Various changes to the 'FieldParser' classes and their mapping.
            - Removs the 'MetadataSourceConfigFieldParser' class.
              This field parser class does not follow the intended abstraction
              model where the parser classes are mapped to expected data types
              based on the "query string". The "metadata fields" could contain
              any type of data, and so this class does not work well with the
              rest of the current implementation.
            - Move functions related to extractors.
              Moves functions and module attributes to 'extractors/__init__.py'
            - Move functions related to analyzers.
              Moves functions and module attributes to 'analyzers/__init__.py'
            - Rename extractor classes to indicate use and type.
              Prepend 'Abstract' to abstract classes, 'Base' to base classes.
            - Adds getting valid query strings at run-time instead of constant.
              Part of moving towards collecting information about valid query
              strings at run-time instead of using predetermined constants.
            - Remove redundant methods in "results" container classes.

            Fixes:
            - Add handling unimplemented evaluation.
            - Improvements to condition validation and configuration parsing.
            - Fixed comparing 'datetime' object with/without timezones.
            - Fix hack import and instantiation of extractors.
              New functions for finding and importing extractor classes from
              suitable python source files helped eliminate ad-hoc imports.


2017-07-10  [autonameow v0.4.3]
            Mostly refactoring and improvements of the internals; parts that
            handle evaluation of rules and validating the configuration are
            rewritten and greatly improved.
            Includes changes to the configuration file syntax, as well as
            compatability tests that alerts that user of this and upcoming
            changes.

            Additions:
            - Add compatability checking the configuration file.
              The program version used to write the file is stored in the
              configuration, this is compared against the version of the
              running program.
            - Add testing 'FieldParser' class suitability with wildcards or
              "globs", similar to the "MIME type globs" used in the 'Extractor'
              classes and for evaluating MIME type conditions in the
              configuration file rules.
            - Add a new "--recursive" option for recursively collecting files
              from all subdirectories of a given path.
            - Add additional integration and unit tests.
            - Add new "Compatibility" integration test suite.
              Some of the tests from the "Command-Line Interface" test suite
              were moved to this new file. New tests were added as well.
            - Add a new 'RuleCondition' class.
              Represents a single condition contained in a configuration file
              rule.  Performs validation of incoming arguments and packages a
              condition to facilitate evaluation.
            - Add unique identifiers to TODOs in the code and the TODO-list.

            Changes:
            - Modify the configuration file syntax.
              The configuration now uses a "flatter" structure as follows;

              Previous, old syntax:
                  -   CONDITIONS:
                      contents:
                          mime_type: image/jpeg
                      filesystem:
                          basename: DCIM.*
                          extension: jpg

              New, "flattened" syntax:
                  -   CONDITIONS:
                      contents.mime_type: image/jpeg
                      filesystem.basename: DCIM.*
                      filesystem.extension: jpg

            - Refactor and cleanup the 'Configuration' class.
            - Rework rule evaluation, now uses the 'FieldParser' classes to
              evaluate conditions. Still a work in progress.
              The "rule matcher" uses the 'RuleCondition' class method
              'evaluate' to evaluating conditions.  The method delegates the
              evaluation to a referenced 'FieldParser' class, that is chosen
              based on the "query string".
            - Various bugfixes and refactoring.
            - Move towards the "new" high-level architecture, separating the
              "core" from "analyzers" and "extractors".

            Fixes:
            - Fix 'FileRule' scores was not reset properly after each file.
            - Fix inconsistencies in the configuration file syntax.
            - Various improvements to handling encoding.
            - Fix broken integration and unit tests.


2017-06-24  [autonameow v0.4.2]
            Includes first attempt at properly fixing encoding issues.  Also a
            lot of cleanup and refactoring.  Refer to the Git log for details.

            Additions:
            - Add unit tests for old code.
            - Add and rework existing unit test mocking functions.
            - Add 'tests/README.md'.
            - Add constant 'MAGIC_TYPE_UNKNOWN' to be used if detection fails.

            Changes:
            - Modify how extractor and analyzer classes are deemed suitable for
              a given file.
              Old method evaluated the given file MIME type against the MIME
              type blobs in each of the classes attribute 'handles_mime_types'.
              Suitability is now tested by a new class method 'can_handle' in
              the 'Extractor' and 'Analyzer' base classes.  The internal
              implementation is the same, but this change opens up for future
              overriding of the 'can_handle' method in each of the inheriting
              classes if they require additional testing.
            - Various code/filename fefactoring and cleanup.
            - Add initial attempt at fixing encoding issues properly.
                - Based on the solution used in the "beets" project, described
                  here:  http://beets.io/blog/paths.html
                - Add reusable functions for encoding/decoding at boundaries.
                - Start reworking code to adhere to the boundaries and keep
                  data encoding/decoding to a minimum within the program.
            - Fall back to a default file rule description if not provided.
            - Rework terminal coloring and modify logging colors.
            - Add initial refactoring of 'namebuilder.py'.
              Move rule matching functions from 'namebuilder.py' to a new file
              'rulematcher.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Improve the 'colorize' function and verify with unit tests.
            - Fix the 'colorize_quoted' function and verify with unit tests.
            - Handle case where results is a dict of dicts.
              Results are flattened and the label is prepended to the results.
            - Add proper handling of MIME type globs in the configuration.
            - Trivial improvements to some of the unit tests execution speed.


2017-06-17  [autonameow v0.4.1]
            This version marks the start of definitiely moving towards
            a redesigned and pretty much frozen high-level architecture.
            Includes major changes. Refer to the Git log for in depth coverage.

            Additions:
            - Improved error handling in the 'NameBuilder' class.
            - Add support for simple globbing in MIME comparisons.
              This is used internally and in the configuration file.

                  MIME to evaluate      Glob          Evaluates
                  ---------------------------------------------
                  'image/jpg'           'image/jpg'        True
                  'image/png'           'image/*'          True
                  'application/pdf'     '*/*'              True
                  'application/pdf'     'image/*'         False

            - Add program version in the configuration file for future
              compatability testing.
            - Add 'TODO.md', which will be the primary list of stuff to do.
              Also added 'done.md' for the completed TODO-list items.

            Changes:
            - Modified the configuration file syntax.
              NOTE: Incompatible with older versions.
            - Major restructuring of overall architecture.
              Move towards separating data extracting from data analysis.
                - Add data extraction handler class 'Extraction' that functions
                  similar to the 'Analysis' class. Builds a queue of
                  "extractors" suited for the given file, executes enqueued
                  extractors and collects the results.
                - Add "extractors" as classes inherting from 'Extractor';

                    - Extractor
                        - MetadataExtractor
                            - ExiftoolMetadataExtractor
                            - PyPDFMetadataExtractor
                        - TextExtractor
                            - PdfTextExtractor
            - Various changes in part of moving towards new architecture.
                - In progress moving of data extraction from "analyzers" to
                  "extractors".
                - Extracted data is passed to the 'Analysis' class and
                  subsequently the "analyzers".

            Fixes:
            - Numerous fixes and corrections.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.
            - Removed a lot of hacks added in order to deliver v0.4.0 on time.


2017-06-06  [autonameow v0.4.0]
            Final version used in the demonstration videos recorded 2017-06-06.
            Includes major changes. Refer to the Git log for in depth coverage.

              This is the first actually usable version! Still very much alpha.

            Additions:
            - Improved out printing with presets and coloring.
            - Added actual renaming of files. '--automagic' mode now
              renames files matched in the configuration file.
            - Add 'santizize_filename' from the "youtube-dl" project.
            - Various utility functions and related unit tests.
            - Add customizable date/time formats in configuration file.
            - Add parsing configuration file rules, conditions and sources.
              Parts of this still needs quite a bit of work.
            - Add 'extractor' package for content extractors that can be used
              by analyzers. Should reduce code duplication.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

            Changes:
            - Major restructuring of module hierarchy.
              All analyzers are moved to a new module 'analyzers' located at
              the same "depth" as the main 'core' module.  This is motivated
              by striving strict separation between the main program core and
              auxiliary modules that perform various tasks like data extraction
              and interaction with other systems.
            - Restructued internal data format. All crucial internal data
              structures are dervied from a reference 'RESULTS_DATA_STRUCTURE'.
            - Start move towards using callbacks to collect analyzer results.
            - Redesigned exiftool wrapper.
            - Abandon 'PyPDF' text extraction. Use 'pdftotext' exclusively.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

            Fixes:
            - Numerous fixes and corrections.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.


2017-05-29  [autonameow v0.3.2]
            Includes major changes to both functionality and implementation.

            Marks the end of development as part of the course work of
            "1DV430 -- Individual Software Development Project", part of
            "Software Development and Operations" at Linnaeus University.

            - Add functions for reading and writing YAML files.
            - Add configuration handling.
                - Configuration data is handled by a 'Configuration' class.
                - Parsing and validation of configuration settings is done
                  by the following subclasses of the 'RuleParser' class;
                    - 'RegexRuleParser'      (Regular expression fields)
                    - 'MimeTypeRuleParser'   (MIME type fields)
                    - 'DateTimeRuleParser'   (Date/time-information fields)
                    - 'NameFormatRuleParser' (File name format string fields)
            - Add custom exceptions using the following inheritance hierarchy;
                - 'AutonameowException' (top-level base class)
                    - 'InvalidFileArgumentError' (invalid arguments)
                    - 'ConfigError' (top-level configuration exception class)

            Fixes:
            - Fix failing unit tests.
            - Fix a lot of miscellaneous bugs.
            - Improve handling of calling unimplemented code.


2017-05-10  [autonameow v0.3.1]
            Insignificant changes of the core functionality. But major rework
            and improvements of the testing code, documentation and structure.

            Additions:
            - Include additional information on the environment in debug mode.
            - Add new option '--config-path' to allow specifying an alternative
              configuration file to use instead of the default configuration
              file at predetermined platform-specific locations.
            - Add shared library for the integration test scripts;
              'tests/integration_utils.sh', contains common utility functions
              used by bash test-scripts, like assertions, execution time
              measurement, logging, etc.
            - Add integration tests and integration test runner;
                - Add main integration runner 'integration_runner.sh'.
                - Add "Test Suite" test suite 'integration_test_tests.sh'.
                - Add "Command-Line Interface" test suite
                  'integration_test_cli.sh'.
                - Add "Documentation" test suite 'integration_test_docs.sh'.
            - Add directory 'devscripts' for developer tools and scripts.
                - Add experimental script 'list-imported-modules.sh'.
            - Add shared library for ALL tests; 'tests/common_utils.sh'.
              Handles setting up paths and global variables that are exported
              to the environment.
            - Add unit test runner; 'unit_runner.py'.
              Wraps 'pytest' which is used to run all unit tests and export the
              test results report to a HTML file.
            - Add (work in progress) runner for ALL tests; 'common_runner.sh'.
              This script will run both integration tests and unit tests and
              produce a summary report which will be included in the project
              wiki page, alternatively uploaded to GitHub pages.

            Changes:
            - Remove matching of rule field 'filename_in_filetags_format'
              in 'RuleMatcher'. Motivation is limiting project scope.
            - Remove prototype integration test; 'tests/run_integration_1.sh'.

            Fixes:
            - Various fixes and corrections to the main source and unit tests.
            - Various fixes and corrections to the utility scripts.


2017-04-24  [autonameow v0.3.0]
            Start developing the project during the course "1DV430 --
            Individual Software Development Project", part of the "Software
            Development and Operations" programme at Linnaeus University.

            Bump version to version v0.3.0, which will be the first version to
            contain changes made during the duration of the course.

            Additions:
            - Add Github-hosted project Wiki:
              https://github.com/1dv430/js224eh-project/wiki
            - Added prototype integration test; 'tests/run_integration_1.sh'.
            - Add new option '--version' that displays the program version
              and exits. This is now the only use of the ASCII-art banner.

            Changes:
            - Make 'guessit' integration optional, silently ignore errors and
              skip code that depend on the module if it is unavailable.
            - Add explicit licensing with GNU General Public License (v2).
              https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt

            Fixes:
            - Various cleanups of non-source files like documentation and notes.
            - Overall restructuring of the project directory hierarchy.
            - Improve wrapper launcher script 'run.sh'
                - Better error-handling and overall robustness.
                - Add OS-specific fixes for MacOS Sierra version '10.12.3' and
                  Linux version '4.4.0-71-generic'.
            - Add simple handling of NotImplementedError exceptions thrown in
              the abstract analyzer base class when an unimplemented field
              attribute getter is called.
            - Fixed various failing unit tests.


2016-12-19  [autonameow v0.2.2]

            Additions:
            - Include exiftool wrapper 'pyexiftool'.
                  http://smarnach.github.com/pyexiftool
                  https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool
              Simply copied in place for now. Dependecies should be handled
              properly, as git submodules, via pip or similar mechanism.
            - Add wrapper script 'run.sh' to act as a main entry point.
            - Start using exiftool in the pdf analyser.
            - Add 'get_publisher' to all analyzers.
            - Implement first version of 'get_publisher' in the PdfAnalyzer.
            - Add comments to indicate overridden methods and attributes.
            - Implement 'get_title' in the PdfAnalyzer.
            - Add ebook name template and matching rules to config defaults.

            Changes:
            - Separate operating mode from actions to perform.
                - Operating mode is either "automagic" or "interactive".
                  Default mode is the (safer (?)) "interactive mode".
                - Options for which actions to perform, for example:
                  "prepend datetime" or "rename" (unimplemented) are separate.
            - Add simpler method for getting fields from analyzers.
            - Change main color in the ASCII art header from yellow to blue.
            - Various changes to the 'namebuilder' class. Still far from done.
            - Various improvements and refactorings in the 'NameBuilder' class.

            Fixes:
            - Fix bug where the message to use '--help' to display help was
              displayed even when '--help' was used.
            - Display  message if the yet unimplemented feature "prepend
              datetime" is enabled.
            - Fix bug in 'prettyprint_options' by explicitly wrapping
              everything in 'str()' calls.


2016-11-14  [autonameow v0.2.1]

            Additions:
            - Improved inline documentation/docstrings.
            - Add priority to the analysis run queue execution.
                - Analyzers are assigned a priority number 0-1, stored in the
                  class variable 'run_queue_priority'.
                - Analysis with a higher number are executed before those
                  with a lower number.
            - Add rule field 'prefer_title'.
              Specifies which title to use, similar to 'prefer_datetime'.
            - Add detecting filename in "filetags" format.
                - Add method 'filetags_format_filename()' to 'FileObject' that
                  returns boolean True if the filename is in "filetags" format.
                - Add unit tests for 'filetags_format_filename()'.
            - Add rules to 'config_defaults.py' for testing.
            - Add matching of rule field 'filename_in_filetags_format' in
              'RuleMatcher'.

            Changes:
            - Start using "Google-style" documentation string formatting.
            - Modified rules in 'config_defaults.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Fix error caused by missing 'string.letters' attribute with
              Python 3. Use 'ascii_letters' for now. Should be fixed.
            - Fix broken unit tests.
            - PIL exception logging debug message caused crash.
            - Fix guessit import statement.
            - Fix logging message was shown regardless of match.


2016-08-28  [autonameow v0.2.0]

            Additions:
            - N/A

            Changes:
            - Migrate project to Python 3.5.
              Drop Python 2 support entirely for simplicity.
              Backwards compatibility fixes might be added at some future time.
            - All source files processed with the '2to3' conversion tool,
              version "2to3-2.7 2.7 January 2012". Some passed unchanged.

            Fixes:
            - N/A


2016-08-19  [autonameow v0.1.8]

            Additions:
            - Add unit tests for 'options.py'.
            - Add a 'NameBuilder' class for assembling new names.
              Fills out the empty template specified by a matching rule with
              data from analysis results.
            - Extend and improve the 'RuleMatcher'.
            - Add dynamic listing of Analyzer classes.
                - Store all analyzer classes in '_ALL_ANALYZER_CLASSES'.
                  The classes are added if their name ends with "Analyzer".
                - Adds function 'get_analyzer_classes' to access the above list.
                - Adds function 'get_instantiated_analyzers' to get a list of
                  analyzer objects.
                  Note that these are instantiated with a None 'FileObject'.
            - Store relevant file mime types in the analyzers themselves.  Add
              a new field 'applies_to_mime' that can be a string, a list of
              strings or None, which means the analyzer should be used
              regardless of file mimetype.

            Changes:
            - Rename the command-line option '--ignore-before-year' to
              '--ignore-to-year'.
            - Rename the command-line option '--ignore-after-year' to
              '--ignore-from-year'.
            - Change how the command-line options are passed in to argparse.
            - Improve function 'arg_is_year'.
            - Remove stub "action" classes 'AbstractAction' and 'RenameAction'.
            - Do not pass filter instances to the analyzers.  Filters were not
              used anyway, instead do the filtering as a separate step after
              the analysis.
            - Analyzers do not execute their analysis at instantiation.
                - Use new method 'run()' to start the analysis.

            Fixes:
            - Fix incorrect number of arguments expected for options
              '--ignore-from-year', '--ignore-years' and '--ignore-to-year'.
            - Rule matcher name regex tests file basename.
            - Fix no matching rule caused crash.


2016-08-09  [autonameow v0.1.7]

            Additions:
            - Extends title extraction in 'FilenameAnalyzer' by weighting
              results by how many "filetags" filename parts are present.

                  Filename:                                   Weight:
                  20160620 Descriptive title -- tags.ext      1
                  20160620 Descriptive title.ext              0.75
                  Descriptive title.ext                       0.25

              Add tests for the above additions and changes.

            - Add unit tests for main program class 'Autonameow'.
            - Extend test cases for the "filename partitioning".
            - Add new option '--automagic' to be used during development.
            - Add a new class 'ResultFilter' for filtering analysis results.

            Changes:
            - Restructure project directory hierarchy.
              Nest most of the main program code in a new package 'core'.
            - Modify logging message levels.  Substitute "warning" for "debug"
              in non-critical blocks for less overall logging output.
            - Move argparse command-line handling to a new file 'options.py'.
            - Removes the short form '-z' of command-line option "debug mode".
            - Improve implementation of command-line option '--dump-options'.

            Fixes:
            - Spelling, formatting and similar minor changes.


2016-08-07  [autonameow v0.1.6]

            Additions:
            - Implement all target features in 'FilesystemAnalyzer' and add the
              relevant tests, making it the first completed analyzer.
            - Extend the "filename partitioning" to include a date-/timestamp.
              Add and/or modify unit tests for extracting 'filenamepart_ts'.

            Changes:
            - Remove the 'Results' class in 'analysis.py' and substitute a
              plain dictionary instead.
            - Rename the actual value key in the results dictionary returned by
              analyzers to "value", instead of the previous "datetime" and
              "title" for datetime and title respectively.
            - Rename 'file_object.py' to 'fileobject.py'.
            - Extract file checks in '_handle_files' to method '_check_file'.
            - Set the "quiet mode" ('-q', '--quiet') default to False.
            - Set the "verbose mode" ('-v', '--verbose') default to False.

            Fixes:
            - Minor logging debug message grammar/spelling fixes.
            - Fix bug where execution with no commad-line arguments causes
              failed read of 'args.verbose'.


2016-07-31  [autonameow v0.1.5]

            Additions:
            - Add new option '--list-title' which dumps all "title" information
              from the analysis results. Similar to '--list-datetime'.
            - Extend tests of "filename partitioning" in the 'FileObject' class.
            - Add more unit tests;
                - Start adding tests for the 'FilenameAnalyzer' class.
                - Start adding tests for the 'FilesystemAnalyzer' class.
            - Add new option '--list-all' which dumps all information

            Changes:
            - Replaced logging errors with assertions.
            - Modify logging message levels to prefer lower level messages such
              as "debug" and "info" before higher levels like "warning" and
              "error".
            - Extend matching "special case" pattern in 'dateandtime.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Remove commented/dead code, listed by class:
                - FileObject: get_oldest_datetime, add_datetime.
                - Analysis: filter_datetime, print_oldest_datetime.
            - Optimize import statements.


2016-07-23  [autonameow v0.1.4]

            Additions:
            - Extend tests for utility file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Add test cases to tests of filename partitioning in 'FileObject'.
            - Add assertions and remove unhelpful warning messages.

            Changes:
            - Various cleanup and formatting fixes.
            - Remove debug print statement.
            - Temporarily disable unicode encoding in 'sanitize_text'.

            Fixes:
            - Remove unused and unfinished code.
                - Method 'prefix_date_to_filename'.
                - Method 'print_oldest_datetime'.
            - Fix incorrect usage of 'FileObject', modify to match new
              attribute names and structure.
            - Update how the 'FilenameAnalyzer' gets tags from filenames.
              Now uses the "partitioned filename" methods in 'FileObject'.


2016-07-22  [autonameow v0.1.3]

            Additions:
            - Add a very fancy ASCII art logo, created with "figlet".
              Displayed only when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Add tests for functions in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Move function 'filetype_magic' to the utility file system
              functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Move responsability for basic file name operations to the utility
              file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Tests for getting file name extensions, file basename, etc.
            - Tests for extracting "filetags" tags.

            Changes:
            - Modify startup "banner" text contents and overall appearance.
            - Improve 'match_special_case' in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Rename 'match_unix_timestamp' to 'match_any_unix_timestamp'.
            - Modify program exit message text.
            - Class 'FileObject' now gets the file type magic from
              'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Remove unused variable 'originalfilename' in 'FileObject'.

            Fixes:
            - Change how "very special case" date format in filenames are
              detected. This prevents duplicate results and is performant.
            - Improve handling filenames, especially compound extensions
              such as "filename.tar.gz" which does have the extension
              ".gz" but when dealing with "filetags" it makes more sense to
              treat all of ".tar.gz" as the extension/suffix.
            - Spell my my last name properly in 'version.py'.
              The encoding definition would allow using "ö", instead of
              the cautious "o". ..right?


2016-07-21  [autonameow v0.1.2]

            Additions:
            - Add parsing filetags from file names, as per the "filetags"
              workflow. Adds 'get_tags' to the abstract analyzer class,
              even though not all analyzer are suited to implement it.
            - Add settings related to the "filetags" workflow to the
              configuration file and default settings.
            - Start adding unit tests for 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add utility file system functions 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'diskutils.py'.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'main.py' to 'autonameow.py'.
            - Cleanup 'autonameow.py';
                - Remove unused code.
                - Rename variables and methods.
                - Make functions out of non-class specific methods.
            - Rename 'doc' directory to 'docs'.
            - Redo the unit tests completely, use different structure.
            - Add program termination message when using '--verbose'.
            - Have 'file_object' instances use the functions in 'diskutils.py'
              for getting their own filenames, etc. This makes it easier to
              test "simple" disk I/O code -- no need to create
              'file_object' instances.

            Fixes:
            - Improve matching UNIX timestamps in 'dateandtime.py'.


2016-07-11  [autonameow v0.1.1]

            Additions:
            - Log the total execution time when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Various improvements and additions to the debugging information
              provided by "logging" when running with the '--debug' option.
            - Add extra date/time search pattern to handle erroneous OCR text
              results where "/" is returned as "7".
            - Add extra date/time search pattern for filenames created by the
              Chrome extension "Full Page Screen Capture".

            Changes:
            - Change logging level for no files specified.
            - Modify logging levels. A number of 'info'-level messages are now
              'debug'-level, motivated by reducing the overall output.
            - Keyboard interrupt handling (ctrl-c) is now handled at a higer
              level so that "most" interrupts are handled properly.
            - Modify extracting date/time-information from filenames.  Adds
              search-methods and modifies the order. Still not very good and
              needs work.
            - Modify the default configuration in 'default_config.py'.
            - Modify how text is "sanitized" after extraction from documents,
              currently only pdfs. Still very broken and needs to be fixed.

            Fixes:
            - Fix pdf page numbering in debug output.
            - Fixes bug in PdfAnalyzer date/time-extraction where results from
              'dt_regex' would end up in 'text_content_brute', leading to the
              bruteforce results never reaching the results.
            - Fix cases where pdf content  extraction with PyPdf2 would return
              a single byte that counted as a successful extraction, preventing
              any additional tries/extractors from being run.


2016-07-08  [autonameow v0.1.0]
            First actual version bump. Development up until now has been at
            version v0.0.1. The code has now (barely) entered a state that
            warrants versioning.

            Additions:
            - Project now has a change log.
            - Basic alpha version of the main program, still severily lacking
              in functionality, stability and consistency.

            Changes:
            - N/A

            Fixes:
            - N/A
