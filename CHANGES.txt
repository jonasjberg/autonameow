2016-08-19  [autonameow v0.1.8]

            Additions:
            - Add unit tests for 'options.py'.
            - Add a 'NameBuilder' class for assembling new names.
              Fills out the empty template specified by a matching rule with
              data from analysis results.
            - Extend and improve the 'RuleMatcher'.
            - Add dynamic listing of Analyzer classes.
            	- Store all analyzer classes in '_ALL_ANALYZER_CLASSES'.
                  The classes are added if their name ends with "Analyzer".
                - Adds function 'get_analyzer_classes' to access the above list.
                - Adds function 'get_instantiated_analyzers' to get a list of
                  analyzer objects.
                  Note that these are instantiated with a None 'FileObject'.
            - Store relevant file mime types in the analyzers themselves.  Add
              a new field 'applies_to_mime' that can be a string, a list of
              strings or None, which means the analyzer should be used
              regardless of file mimetype.

            Changes:
            - Rename the command-line option '--ignore-before-year' to
              '--ignore-to-year'.
            - Rename the command-line option '--ignore-after-year' to
              '--ignore-from-year'.
            - Change how the command-line options are passed in to argparse.
            - Improve function 'arg_is_year'.
            - Remove stub "action" classes 'AbstractAction' and 'RenameAction'.
            - Do not pass filter instances to the analyzers.  Filters were not
              used anyway, instead do the filtering as a separate step after
              the analysis.
			- Analyzers do not execute their analysis at instantiation.
				- Use new method 'run()' to start the analysis.

            Fixes:
            - Fix incorrect number of arguments expected for options
              '--ignore-from-year', '--ignore-years' and '--ignore-to-year'.
            - Rule matcher name regex tests file basename.
			- Fix no matching rule caused crash.


2016-08-09  [autonameow v0.1.7]

            Additions:
            - Extends title extraction in 'FilenameAnalyzer' by weighting
              results by how many "filetags" filename parts are present.

                  Filename:                                   Weight:
                  20160620 Descriptive title -- tags.ext      1
                  20160620 Descriptive title.ext              0.75
                  Descriptive title.ext                       0.25

              Add tests for the above additions and changes.

            - Add unit tests for main program class 'Autonameow'.
            - Extend test cases for the "filename partitioning".
            - Add new option '--automagic' to be used during development.
            - Add a new class 'ResultFilter' for filtering analysis results.

            Changes:
            - Restructure project directory hierarchy.
              Nest most of the main program code in a new package 'core'.
            - Modify logging message levels.  Substitute "warning" for "debug"
              in non-critical blocks for less overall logging output.
            - Move argparse command-line handling to a new file 'options.py'.
            - Removes the short form '-z' of command-line option "debug mode".
            - Improve implementation of command-line option '--dump-options'.

            Fixes:
            - Spelling, formatting and similar minor changes.


2016-08-07  [autonameow v0.1.6]

            Additions:
            - Implement all target features in 'FilesystemAnalyzer' and add the
              relevant tests, making it the first completed analyzer.
            - Extend the "filename partitioning" to include a date-/timestamp.
              Add and/or modify unit tests for extracting 'filenamepart_ts'.

            Changes:
            - Remove the 'Results' class in 'analysis.py' and substitute a
              plain dictionary instead.
            - Rename the actual value key in the results dictionary returned by
              analyzers to "value", instead of the previous "datetime" and
              "title" for datetime and title respectively.
            - Rename 'file_object.py' to 'fileobject.py'.
            - Extract file checks in '_handle_files' to method '_check_file'.
            - Set the "quiet mode" ('-q', '--quiet') default to False.
            - Set the "verbose mode" ('-v', '--verbose') default to False.

            Fixes:
            - Minor logging debug message grammar/spelling fixes.
            - Fix bug where execution with no commad-line arguments causes
              failed read of 'args.verbose'.


2016-07-31  [autonameow v0.1.5]

            Additions:
            - Add new option '--list-title' which dumps all "title" information
              from the analysis results. Similar to '--list-datetime'.
            - Extend tests of "filename partitioning" in the 'FileObject' class.
            - Add more unit tests;
                - Start adding tests for the 'FilenameAnalyzer' class.
                - Start adding tests for the 'FilesystemAnalyzer' class.
            - Add new option '--list-all' which dumps all information

            Changes:
            - Replaced logging errors with assertions.
            - Modify logging message levels to prefer lower level messages such
              as "debug" and "info" before higher levels like "warning" and
              "error".
            - Extend matching "special case" pattern in 'dateandtime.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Remove commented/dead code, listed by class:
                - FileObject: get_oldest_datetime, add_datetime.
                - Analysis: filter_datetime, print_oldest_datetime.
            - Optimize import statements.


2016-07-23  [autonameow v0.1.4]

            Additions:
            - Extend tests for utility file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Add test cases to tests of filename partitioning in 'FileObject'.
            - Add assertions and remove unhelpful warning messages.

            Changes:
            - Various cleanup and formatting fixes.
            - Remove debug print statement.
            - Temporarily disable unicode encoding in 'sanitize_text'.

            Fixes:
            - Remove unused and unfinished code.
                - Method 'prefix_date_to_filename'.
                - Method 'print_oldest_datetime'.
            - Fix incorrect usage of 'FileObject', modify to match new
              attribute names and structure.
            - Update how the 'FilenameAnalyzer' gets tags from filenames.
              Now uses the "partitioned filename" methods in 'FileObject'.


2016-07-22  [autonameow v0.1.3]

            Additions:
            - Add a very fancy ASCII art logo, created with "figlet".
              Displayed only when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Add tests for functions in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Move function 'filetype_magic' to the utility file system
              functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Move responsability for basic file name operations to the utility
              file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Tests for getting file name extensions, file basename, etc.
            - Tests for extracting "filetags" tags.

            Changes:
            - Modify startup "banner" text contents and overall appearance.
            - Improve 'match_special_case' in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Rename 'match_unix_timestamp' to 'match_any_unix_timestamp'.
            - Modify program exit message text.
            - Class 'FileObject' now gets the file type magic from
              'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Remove unused variable 'originalfilename' in 'FileObject'.

            Fixes:
            - Change how "very special case" date format in filenames are
              detected. This prevents duplicate results and is performant.
            - Improve handling filenames, especially compound extensions
              such as "filename.tar.gz" which does have the extension
              ".gz" but when dealing with "filetags" it makes more sense to
              treat all of ".tar.gz" as the extension/suffix.
            - Spell my my last name properly in 'version.py'.
              The encoding definition would allow using "รถ", instead of
              the cautious "o". ..right?


2016-07-21  [autonameow v0.1.2]

            Additions:
            - Add parsing filetags from file names, as per the "filetags"
              workflow. Adds 'get_tags' to the abstract analyzer class,
              even though not all analyzer are suited to implement it.
            - Add settings related to the "filetags" workflow to the
              configuration file and default settings.
            - Start adding unit tests for 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add utility file system functions 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'diskutils.py'.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'main.py' to 'autonameow.py'.
            - Cleanup 'autonameow.py';
                - Remove unused code.
                - Rename variables and methods.
                - Make functions out of non-class specific methods.
            - Rename 'doc' directory to 'docs'.
            - Redo the unit tests completely, use different structure.
            - Add program termination message when using '--verbose'.
            - Have 'file_object' instances use the functions in 'diskutils.py'
              for getting their own filenames, etc. This makes it easier to
              test "simple" disk I/O code -- no need to create
              'file_object' instances.

            Fixes:
            - Improve matching UNIX timestamps in 'dateandtime.py'.


2016-07-11  [autonameow v0.1.1]

            Additions:
            - Log the total execution time when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Various improvements and additions to the debugging information
              provided by "logging" when running with the '--debug' option.
            - Add extra date/time search pattern to handle erroneous OCR text
              results where "/" is returned as "7".
            - Add extra date/time search pattern for filenames created by the
              Chrome extension "Full Page Screen Capture".

            Changes:
            - Change logging level for no files specified.
            - Modify logging levels. A number of 'info'-level messages are now
              'debug'-level, motivated by reducing the overall output.
            - Keyboard interrupt handling (ctrl-c) is now handled at a higer
              level so that "most" interrupts are handled properly.
            - Modify extracting date/time-information from filenames.  Adds
              search-methods and modifies the order. Still not very good and
              needs work.
            - Modify the default configuration in 'default_config.py'.
            - Modify how text is "sanitized" after extraction from documents,
              currently only pdfs. Still very broken and needs to be fixed.

            Fixes:
            - Fix pdf page numbering in debug output.
            - Fixes bug in PdfAnalyzer date/time-extraction where results from
              'dt_regex' would end up in 'text_content_brute', leading to the
              bruteforce results never reaching the results.
            - Fix cases where pdf content  extraction with PyPdf2 would return
              a single byte that counted as a successful extraction, preventing
              any additional tries/extractors from being run.


2016-07-08  [autonameow v0.1.0]
            First actual version bump. Development up until now has been at
            version v0.0.1. The code has now (barely) entered a state that
            warrants versioning.

            Additions:
            - Project now has a change log.
            - Basic alpha version of the main program, still severily lacking
              in functionality, stability and consistency.

            Changes:
            - N/A

            Fixes:
            - N/A
