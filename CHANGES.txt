2016-07-31  [autonameow v0.1.5]

            Additions:
            - Add new option '--list-title' which dumps all "title" information
              from the analysis results. Similar to '--list-datetime'.
            - Extend tests of "filname partitioning" in the 'FileObject' class.
            - Add more unit tests;
                - Start adding tests for the 'FilenameAnalyzer' class.
                - Start adding tests for the 'FilesystemAnalyzer' class.
            - Add new option '--list-all' which dumps all information

            Changes:
            - Replaced logging errors with assertions.
            - Modify logging message levels to prefer lower level messages such
              as "debug" and "info" before higher levels like "warning" and
              "error".
            - Extend matching "special case" pattern in 'dateandtime.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Remove commented/dead code, listed by class:
                - FileObject: get_oldest_datetime, add_datetime.
                - Analysis: filter_datetime, print_oldest_datetime.
            - Optimize import statements.


2016-07-23  [autonameow v0.1.4]

            Additions:
            - Extend tests for utility file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Add test cases to tests of filename partitioning in 'FileObject'.
            - Add assertions and remove unhelpful warning messages.

            Changes:
            - Various cleanup and formatting fixes.
            - Remove debug print statement.
            - Temporarily disable unicode encoding in 'sanitize_text'.

            Fixes:
            - Remove unused and unfinished code.
                - Method 'prefix_date_to_filename'.
                - Method 'print_oldest_datetime'.
            - Fix incorrect usage of 'FileObject', modify to match new
              attribute names and structure.
            - Update how the 'FilenameAnalyzer' gets tags from filenames.
              Now uses the "partitioned filename" methods in 'FileObject'.


2016-07-22  [autonameow v0.1.3]

            Additions:
            - Add a very fancy ASCII art logo, created with "figlet".
              Displayed only when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Add tests for functions in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Move function 'filetype_magic' to the utility file system
              functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Move responsability for basic file name operations to the utility
              file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Tests for getting file name extensions, file basename, etc.
            - Tests for extracting "filetags" tags.

            Changes:
            - Modify startup "banner" text contents and overall appearance.
            - Improve 'match_special_case' in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Rename 'match_unix_timestamp' to 'match_any_unix_timestamp'.
            - Modify program exit message text.
            - Class 'FileObject' now gets the file type magic from
              'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Remove unused variable 'originalfilename' in 'FileObject'.

            Fixes:
            - Change how "very special case" date format in filenames are
              detected. This prevents duplicate results and is performant.
            - Improve handling filenames, especially compound extensions
              such as "filename.tar.gz" which does have the extension
              ".gz" but when dealing with "filetags" it makes more sense to
              treat all of ".tar.gz" as the extension/suffix.
            - Spell my my last name properly in 'version.py'.
              The encoding definition would allow using "รถ", instead of
              the cautious "o". ..right?


2016-07-21  [autonameow v0.1.2]

            Additions:
            - Add parsing filetags from file names, as per the "filetags"
              workflow. Adds 'get_tags' to the abstract analyzer class,
              even though not all analyzer are suited to implement it.
            - Add settings related to the "filetags" workflow to the
              configuration file and default settings.
            - Start adding unit tests for 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add utility file system functions 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'diskutils.py'.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'main.py' to 'autonameow.py'.
            - Cleanup 'autonameow.py';
                - Remove unused code.
                - Rename variables and methods.
                - Make functions out of non-class specific methods.
            - Rename 'doc' directory to 'docs'.
            - Redo the unit tests completely, use different structure.
            - Add program termination message when using '--verbose'.
            - Have 'file_object' instances use the functions in 'diskutils.py'
              for getting their own filenames, etc. This makes it easier to
              test "simple" disk I/O code -- no need to create
              'file_object' instances.

            Fixes:
            - Improve matching UNIX timestamps in 'dateandtime.py'.


2016-07-11  [autonameow v0.1.1]

            Additions:
            - Log the total execution time when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Various improvements and additions to the debugging information
              provided by "logging" when running with the '--debug' option.
            - Add extra date/time search pattern to handle erroneous OCR text
              results where "/" is returned as "7".
            - Add extra date/time search pattern for filenames created by the
              Chrome extension "Full Page Screen Capture".

            Changes:
            - Change logging level for no files specified.
            - Modify logging levels. A number of 'info'-level messages are now
              'debug'-level, motivated by reducing the overall output.
            - Keyboard interrupt handling (ctrl-c) is now handled at a higer
              level so that "most" interrupts are handled properly.
            - Modify extracting date/time-information from filenames.  Adds
              search-methods and modifies the order. Still not very good and
              needs work.
            - Modify the default configuration in 'default_config.py'.
            - Modify how text is "sanitized" after extraction from documents,
              currently only pdfs. Still very broken and needs to be fixed.

            Fixes:
            - Fix pdf page numbering in debug output.
            - Fixes bug in PdfAnalyzer date/time-extraction where results from
              'dt_regex' would end up in 'text_content_brute', leading to the
              bruteforce results never reaching the results.
            - Fix cases where pdf content  extraction with PyPdf2 would return
              a single byte that counted as a successful extraction, preventing
              any additional tries/extractors from being run.


2016-07-08  [autonameow v0.1.0]
            First actual version bump. Development up until now has been at
            version v0.0.1. The code has now (barely) entered a state that
            warrants versioning.

            Additions:
            - Project now has a change log.
            - Basic alpha version of the main program, still severily lacking
              in functionality, stability and consistency.

            Changes:
            - N/A

            Fixes:
            - N/A
