2018-02-20  [autonameow v0.5.5]
            Adds new metadata extractor 'PandocMetadataExtractor'
            that extracts titles, heading, table of contents, authors, etc.
            from various document file types.
            Also adds two new text extractors: 'MarkdownTextExtractor' and
            'RichTextFormatTextExtractor'.

            Adds ability to pass in arbitrary "views" instead of directly
            accessing the 'ui' module functionality, which is utilized
            in the regression tests to do pattern matching assertions on
            stdout and stderr.

            Various refactorings and bug fixes. Removes some stale or
            unimplemented functionality. Adds missing tests.

            Additions
            - Add new extractor 'PandocMetadataExtractor'.
              Adds a new document metadata extractor using 'pandoc'.

              This currently uses 'pandoc' to convert documents using a custom
              template that effectively translates generic document elements
              into YAML-formatted data, that is loaded into a plain dict.

              One possible alternative method is to use JSON as the output format
              and parse that, but this is a lot messier and involves parsing
              abstract syntax tree nodes used by 'pandoc'.
              I am sure there are better ways to do this, but the custom template
              strategy was the first that came to mind.

              This functionality could alternatively have been added to the text
              extractors as per TODO-list item [TD0172] on extending text extractors
              with additional fields. Currently they only provide leaf 'full'.

              Might still go that route, but it would involve rethinking how text
              extractors operate in order to reduce multiple calls to do the
              extraction, etc.

              References TODO-list item [TD0173].

            - Add new markdown text extractor.
              Adds new text extractor class 'MarkdownTextExtractor'.
              Uses 'pandoc' to convert markdown files to plain text.

            - Add new RTF text extractor.
              Adds a new RTF text extractor, 'RichTextFormatTextExtractor'.

            - Add parsing date/time strings with timezone and uS.
              Adds handling of date/time-strings with microseconds and timezone.

            - Pass in a user interface to the 'Autonameow' class.
              Adds passing the 'view' to the main 'Autonameow' class.
              Part of changes to separate the view from the core logic.

              Adds new TODO [TD0170] on using a mock UI in the 'AutonameowWrapper'
              class, used by the regression test runner.

              References [TD0111].

            - Add 'MockUI.msg()' calls to captured stdout.
              Adds captured 'MockUI.msg()' calls to captured stdout.

              Re-enables stdout matching assertions in regression test suite
              '0010_dump_meowuris_a'.

              Completes TODO-list item [TD0170].

            - Add filesystem wrapper functions.
              Handles encoding and avoids repeatedly calling 'enc.syspath()'
              everywhere.
              Re-raises various exceptions to a single exception type.

            - Add persistence back-end specific exception class.
              Adds exception class 'PersistenceImplementationBackendError'.

              Should be used by implementing persistence classes to re-raise
              any exceptions raised in the '_load()' and '_dump()' methods.

            - Extend the 'MockUI' class. Add unit tests.

            - Do not warn if no text is present. Add asserts.

            - Add big fixes/changes to data formats.
              Adds fixes related to TODOs [TD0102][TD0157][TD0115][TD0112] ..

              Analyzers previously constructed "meta" dicts inline by various ad-hoc
              means, often in "_wrap_*" methods.
              This commit makes analyzers and extractors use the same function
              'wrap_provider_results()' that reads the meta info from class attribute
              'FIELD_LOOKUP'.
              This also reduces flexibility in analyzers.
              But it becoming all the more obvious that analyzers need to be reworked
              to be a useful concept and provide more flexibility.

              This also effectively integrates the concept of a 'DataBundle',
              which is a simple wrapper class for storing data produced by providers.

              Adds TODOs:

              [TD0167] MeowURIs in databundles is only needed by the resolver.
              [TD0166] No longer possible to set probabilities dynamically due to
                 analyzers using the shared "wrapping" that reads probabilities
                       from the 'FIELD_LOOKUP'.

              Completes TODO-list item [TD0165].

            - Add new regression tests.

            - Add function 'sort_by_mapped_weights()'.
              Adds function for sorting lists of 'DataBundle' to the resolver.

              Intended for ranking of bundles from generic MeowURIs.

              Refers to [TD0112] on handling "equivalent" data.

            - Add method 'DataBundle.field_mapping_probability()'
              Adds a accessor for the probability of a mapped field.

              If the bundle has the field in a weighted mapping,
              the probability (weight) for that field is returned.
              Otherwise a default value of 0.0 is returned.

            - Add 'DataBundle.maps_field()'.
              Adds method with same functionality as function with same name.

            - Add test utility function 'get_expected_text_for_testfile()'.

              Instead of storing expected text as strings in the unit tests
              themselves, the expected text should be stored in files in the
              'test_files' directory. These files must have the same basename
              as their corresponding source file with '_expected.txt' appended.

              This function returns expected text for a given test file basename.

            - Add unit tests for 'RichTextFormatTextExtractor'.

            - Add integration tests for 'pdftotext' and 'unrtf'.

            - Add integration tests for 'test_files'.
              Adds tests that verify sample test files used by other tests.

              Intended to prevent confusion following unintended renaming of
              test files that break following tests that use them.

            - Add 'test_files/ObjectCalisthenics.rtf'.

            - Add 'RTF:*' to exiftool extractor 'FIELD_LOOKUP'.
              Adds 'RTF:*' fields to 'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor.FIELD_LOOKUP'.

            - Add basic integration testing of the test runners.

            - Add passing multiple '-f' to regression runner.
              Adds passing multiple '-f'/'--filter' to the regression runner.

              Results of multiple filter are ORed together, which provides
              pretty good flexibility in combination with the ability to negate
              matches by prefixing a '!' to the filter expression.

            - Implement 'MultipleTypes.__contains__()'.
              Adds checking if a specific coercer is used in a 'MultipleTypes'.

              Example usage:

                  list_of_strings_coercer = types.listof(types.AW_STRING)
                  assert types.AW_STRING in list_of_string_coercer

            - Add function 'force_meowuri()'.
              Adds convenience function similar to 'force_string()'.

              Returns a valid MeowURI or None, ignores any and all exceptions.

            - Add unit tests using dumped MeowURIs.

            - Add utility function 'flatten_sequence_type()'.
              Flattens arbitrarily nested lists or tuples of tuples and/or lists.

            - Add unit tests for 'filter_able_to_handle()'.

            - Add assertion and change log level in 'extract.py'.

            - Add "string to MeowURI boundary" for analyzers.
              Adds "boundary" for converting strings to MeowURIs.

              This really should not be required by the individual analyzers.
              Probably better to handle this in one spot as part of the interfacing
              layer that separates analyzers from the rest of the program.

            - Handle parsing instances of 'MeowURI'. Add tests.
              Adds ability to pass instances of 'MeowURI' to a new 'MeowURI'.

              This means that a new MeowURI can be created from either
              strings, MeowURIs or combinations of strings and MeowURIs.

              Adds new and reworks old unit tests and adds property-based tests.

            - Rename 'validate_path_argument()'. Add tests.

            - Add integration tests for stand-alone extractor.
              Adds integration tests that verify results of stand-alone extraction.

              Intended to verify correctness of the interface used by the stand-alone
              extractor.

            - Add module attribute dict 'MetadataProviderClasses'.
              Adds a "public" interface to all available text extractors.

              Similar to 'ProviderClasses' that includes all types of extractors.

            - Add and clean up unit tests in 'test_extractors.py'.

            - Add module attribute dict 'TextProviderClasses'.
              Adds a "public" interface to all available text extractors.

              Similar to 'ProviderClasses' that includes all types of extractors.

            Changes
            - Remove the unimplemented 'ImageAnalyzer'.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0169].

            - Remove the 'TextAnalyzer'.
              Removes the unimplemented 'TextAnalyzer'. Completes TODO [TD0168].
              The 'ImageAnalyzer' and 'TextAnalyzer' was disabled because they do not
              actually do and return results in a format that deviates from the other
              providers.
              And the 'FiletagsAnalyzer' was rework to a extractor.

            - Remove 'epubzilla'.
              Removes the bundled third-party 'epubzilla' library.

            - Use 'ebooklib' in the 'EpubTextExtractor'.

            - Remove 'cPickle' imports, not needed in Python 3.

            - Improve last-attempt parsing in 'try_parse_date()'.
              Improves parsing of dates used in 'AW_DATE'.
              Now effectively truncates values until a match is found.
              Previously dates that did not contain year, month and day was not
              handled.  Now only a year is required in to return a valid datetime.

            - Do not request already available data.
              Use 'FileObject' data instead of requesting in the 'FilenameAnalyzer'.
              Use 'FileObject' data directly in plugins.
              Completes [TD0136].
              Removes querying for data already available from the 'FileObject'.

            - Remove 'NameTemplateField.normalize()' methods.
              Removes mostly unused methods in 'NameTemplateField' subclasses.

              This should be user-configurable and the same functionality is
              still provided through the "post-processing" replacements, however
              not field-specific.

            - Simplify stand-alone metadata extraction.
              Simplifies stand-alone extraction runner 'extract.py'.

              Uses newly improved interface provided by the extractor runner
              to run only metadata extractors.

            - Simplify stand-alone extraction.
              Simplifies stand-alone extraction runner 'extract.py'.

              Uses newly improved interface provided by the extractor runner
              to run only text extractors.

            - Simplify collecting extractor classes.
              Removes leftover collecting of extractor class from modules.

              All extractor classes are now divided into packages.
              Previously, some extractor was stored outside of these packages
              in a separate file. Functions for retrieving these was left behind
              after the last of these extractors were changed/removed.

              This commit removes these unnecessary functions and simplifies
              collection of extractor classes a great deal.

              Completes TODO-list item [TD0127].

            - Do not pass available extractors to runner.
              Removes argument 'available_extractors' from 'ExtractorRunner' init.

              This class currently only gets accessed through the module-level
              'run_extraction()' function, which populated this argument.  But this
              is pretty much equivalent to having the class grab this data itself at
              instantiation.

              The old method might provide a means of controlling which extractors
              should be made available to the runner, but for now this probably only
              adds unnecessary complexity.

            - Use 'msg()' instead of logging replacements.
              Logging messes with the alignment of the replacement message strings.

            - Print stacktraces when assertions fail.
              Adds printing stacktraces when regression runner assertions fail.

            - Add filesystem wrapper function 'rmdir()'.
              Removes unimplemented directory deletion from 'delete()'.

            - Do not emit error messages from 'PathCollector'.

            - Exclude local regression tests in 'run_all_tests.sh'.

            - Use utility filesystem functions in 'BasePersistence'.

            - Remove bytestring checks in 'has_permissions()'.
              Workaround used by 'argparse' to validate Unicode str arguments.

            - Clean up the 'PathCollector' class.
              Moves matching paths to globs to separate function.

              Adds additional tests. Reworks exception handling slightly.

            - Use keyword arguments for clarity.

            - Clean up 'argparse' argument validation functions.

            - Use common filesystem functions in 'fileobject.py'.
              Modifies path validation to not accept Unicode paths.

              Also adds using the utility file system wrappers instead
              of inline handling of path encoding. This means repeated
              calls to 'syspath()', but should not be a huge problem.

            - Extract function '_key_as_file_path()'.
              Extracts part of '_persistence_file_abspath()' into separate function.

            - Use functions in 'io.py' for checking files.
              Adds using 'io.py' functions to avoid inline handling of path encoding.

            - Simplify storage in the 'Repository'.
              Removes using 'nested_dict_*' functions to store 'Repository' data.

              References [TD0167].

            - Handle 'AttributeError' in 'BasePersistence'.
              Logs 'AttributeError' and raises log level of top-level exceptions.

            - Fix duplicate 'EbookAnalyzer' MIME-type evaluation.
              Removes code duplication by using parent class method.

            - Use consistent handling of MIME-glob eval error.
              Modifies error handling in 'EbookAnalyzer.can_handle()'.

              Prevent using a possibly undefined log and handle failed
              MIME-glob evaluation errors like the other extractor classes
              that do not override 'can_handle()'.

            - Raise 'TypeError' for bad ordering of 'MeowURI'.
              Raises 'TypeError' when attempting to order MeowURIs and other types.

            - Replace 'IndexError, KeyError' with 'LookupError'.

            - Rework extractor unit test inheritance.
              Improves use base classes in extractor unit tests.

              Previously a lot of tests were skipped, printing warnings and
              polluting the results. This was caused by having the base classes
              with shared functionality inherit from 'unittest.TestCase'.
              This commit fixes this by only inheriting from 'unittest.TestCase'
              in the test classes that use the shared functionality.

              The same change is also made to the property-based tests of the
              config field parsers.

            - Work around circular import problems in 'provider.py'.
              Adds inline imports to work around import problems.

              Only seems to happen when running the alternative unit test runner.

                  $ PYTHONPATH=autonameow:tests python3 -m unit --skip-slow

            - Rework the 'FileRenamer' class.
              Separates 'FileRenamer' class from all user interface interaction.

              Example usage with a "timid" renamer:

                  renamer = FileRenamer(dry_run=True, timid=True)
                  renamer.add_pending(b'/foo/bar', 'baz')
                  if renamer.needs_confirmation:
                      for filename_delta in renamer.needs_confirmation:
                          renamer.confirm(filename_delta)
                  renamer.do_renames()

              Example usage with a renamer that does not require confirmation:

                  renamer = FileRenamer(dry_run=True, timid=False)
                  renamer.add_pending(b'/foo/bar', 'baz')
                  renamer.do_renames()

              Fixes issues related to [TD0171] on separating logic from the UI.

            - Make 'check_option_combinations()' a function.
              Moves static method 'Autonameow.check_option_combinations()'.

            - Pass back actual 'ColumnFormatter' from 'MockUI'.
              Temporarily use 'ColumnFormatter' in regression tests.

              References TODO-list item [TD0171].

            - Simplify the 'MockUI' class.
              Replaces actual methods and with using '__getattr__'.

              Adds additional unit tests.

            - Use mock UI in regression tests.
              Adds passing in a mock UI to the main 'Autonameow' class in tests.

              Uses a 'MockUI' class that defines methods that mirrors functions
              exposed in the 'core.ui' package.

              References TODO-list item [TD0170].

            - Explicitly use 'view.cli' in the regression runner.
              Adds explicitly specifying 'view.cli' functionality when required.

            - Explicitly use 'view.cli' in 'logs.py'.
              Adds explicitly specifying 'view.cli' functionality when required.

            - Rename 'ui' to 'view'.
              Renames the 'ui' package to 'view'.

              The plan is to use 'ui' to refer to the currently active view
              and so the package name is renamed to prevent name conflicts.

            - Use 'cli.msg()' instead of print in 'cli_main()'.

            - Do not buffer when printing errors in 'main.py'.

            - Improve regression test stdout assertions.
              Adds printing failed and passed stdout match assertions.

              This is currently buggy, the captured stdout is inconsistent
              depending on which regression tests that are included.

            - Print exception errors with the 'TerminalReporter'.
              Cleans up displaying error messages in the regression runner.

              Moves displaying messages on "top-level exceptions" and the
              captured exception traceback to the 'TerminalReporter' class.

            - Catch 'ValueError' raised by 'pyexiftool'.
              Adds catching 'pyexiftool' exception in the 'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor'.

              ValueError can be raised by 'pyexiftool' when aborting with CTRL-C.

                  self._process.stdin.write(b"-stay_open\nFalse\n")
                  ValueError: write to closed file

              Should probably clean up the messy nested try-catch clauses.

            - Use non-buffered printing in regression runner.
              Adds printing regression runner output at once.

              This makes sure that the name of a slow regression test suite
              is displayed before that test in started.

            - Modify regression runner filtering from OR to AND.
              Modifies how multiple filter options works in the regression runner.

              This also fixes a bug where filtering resulted in duplicate tests.

            - Rename 'PdftotextTextExtractor' to 'PdfTextExtractor'.
              Renames the pdf text extractor class and related source files.

              Makes a lot more sense to not bother with leaving room for many
              different extractors for the same file type. Users probably
              will not be interested in specifying exactly which back-end program
              is used to get the text.

              Users should not even have to specify which extractor class to use,
              something like 'extractor.text.full' should be enough.

            - Remove redundant else-clauses.

            - Remove duplicate key in 'EbookAnalyzer.FIELD_LOOKUP'.

            - Do not pass None arguments to '__import__()'.

            - Return 'QueryResponseFailure' if missing MeowURI.
              Adds returning 'QueryResponseFailure' instead of raising exception.

              Do not raise a 'InvalidMeowURIError' that is almost guaranteed to
              not be uncaught by the caller and propagate too far.
              Instead return an instance of 'QueryResponseFailure' that simply
              evaluates to false.

            - Remove string decoding and test for empty text.

            - Improve finding date/time in the 'FilenameAnalyzer'.
              Cleans up collecting date/time-information from file names.

              Completes TODO-list item [TD0019].

            - Factor out duplicate code in 'dateandtime.py'.

            - Clean up 'match_special_case()'.

            - Make method '_get_title_from_text()' a function.
              Changes '_get_title_from_text()' into 'find_titles_in_text()'.

            - Remove completed TODO-list item [TD0142].

            - Remove unimplemented 'VideoAnalyzer'.
              Removes the non-functional 'VideoAnalyzer' class.

              Also removes TODO-list item [TD0055]'.

            - Remove searching for datetime in 'DocumentAnalyzer'.
              Removes passing back date/time-information using older method.

              This inline wrapping of results dicts in a list does not work with
              the other systems that use 'FIELD_LOOKUP' to wrap values into the
              dicts.  The returned 'value' would be a list of additional dicts,
              which would break systems that receive this data.

            - Remove caching in 'MasterDataProvider'.
              Removes unnecessary caching of repository data.

            - Do not assume at least one analyzer applies.
              This no longer holds after disabling and reworking analyzers.
              It could now very well be that no analyzers applies to a given file.

            - Improve handling of failed imports in epub text extractor.

            - Display failed regression test stdout assertions.

            - Do not return non-zero if name template is unknown.

            - Remove 'FiletagsAnalyzer'. Add 'FiletagsExtractor'.
              Reworks the filetags analyzer into a extractor.

              Functionality should be basically unchanged.
              Because the 'FiletagsAnalyzer' was very simple and did not require much
              of "contextual information" it is arguably better suited as a extractor.

              This was also in part an exercise in evaluating the overall architecture
              and how much friction is involved in creating new extractors.

              MeowURIs 'analyzer.filetags.*' are now 'extractor.filesystem.filetags.*'

            - Remove old-style 'super()' calls.

            - Fix regressions introduced in 353fcd74100d68b6523.
              Fixes regressions introduced when fixing skipping some metadata.

              Changes in commit 353fcd74100d68b6523f17ee7c276c7c8c221dc2 caused
              some of the regression tests that used generic data sources for
              name template fields.
              The changes caused additional valid metadata to be extracted,
              causing the resolver to fail because it could not pick out which
              of multiple possible candidates to use.

              This is now fixed by adding a simple means of picking out one piece
              of data from a list of candidates, based on the hardcoded
              'WeightedMapping' probabilities that is assigned by providers.

              So given a "generic" MeowURI such as 'generic.metadata.title',
              the candidate that has the highest WeightedMapping probability
              to the name template field 'Title' is used.
              The current solution will have to be reworked to work in a general
              case and be less confusing ..

            - Modify 'WeightedMapping' probabilities.
              Modifies the 'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor' field probabilities.

              Arbitrary and immaterial changes related to other unit tests.

            - Move expected text to files.
              Moves expected texts in unit tests to separate files.

            - Do not warn about failed 'FIELD_LOOKUP' assumptions.
              Instead of skipping and printing errors, simply coerce into list.

            - Update alternative unit test runner.
              Adds argument parsing, filtering and showing test run times.

            - Rename unit test path constants. Rework tests.

            - Rewrite integration test case description.

            - Extract whitespace integration tests to script.
              Adds a new script 'devscripts/check_whitespace.sh'.

              Moves some of the test cases in 'tests/integration/test_src.sh'
              to a separate script.
              Checks text file style violations, whitespace, line separators, etc.
              Returns 1 at first failing check. Returns 0 if all checks pass.

            - Have prompt fall back to in-memory history.
              Adds using previously unused 'InMemoryHistory' as fallback.

            - Set up Unicode string encoding boundary in 'ui'.
              Fix handling conversion to Unicode strings before passing to ui.

              Adds assertions and additional unit tests.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0156].

            - Modify exception throw by 'Renamer.do_rename()'.
              Adds using 'FilesystemError' instead of 'AutonameowException'.

            - Remove unused unit test "mocking" functions.

            - Rename unit test class with duplicated name.

            - Modify string conversion in stand-alone extractor.
              Modifies conversion to Unicode strings in the stand-alone extractor.

              The previous version used the coercer classes format method,
              which returns the value in a form suitable for use in file names.
              However, the repository used another method for converting values to
              displayable (Unicode string) form, which resulted in different results
              printed by 'autonameow --list-all' and the stand-alone extractor.

              Stand-alone extractor:

                  extractor.metadata.exiftool.File:MIMEType    pdf

              autonameow --list-all:

                  extractor.metadata.exiftool.File:MIMEType    application/pdf

              This commit modifies the stand-alone extractor to use the string
              conversion method used in 'Repository.__str__()'.

            - Remove completed TODO-item [TD0150].

            - Update 'test_files/README.txt'.

            - Remove leftover pickled state experiment.

            - Move 'ProviderRegistry._get_generic_sources()'.
              Extracts method '_get_generic_sources()' into a function.

              Method '_get_generic_sources()' is now '_map_generic_sources()'.

            - Reimplement '--list-all'.
              Adds back lost '--list-all' functionality.

              Runs all providers through new functionality added to the
              'MasterDataProvider' and 'provider.py'.
              This might not be the best place to put this, but it was the
              simplest way of solving this without very invasive changes.

            - Disable unnecessary regression tests '--list-all'.

            - Non-functional changes to 'RuleConditionEvaluator'.

            - Refactor 'CrossPlatformFileSystemExtractor'.
              Factors out main extraction routines into separate methods.

            - Remove superfluous 'pass' statements.

            - Uppercase extractor class attribute 'is_slow'.

            - Add partial fixes referencing [TD0112][TD0115].
              Adds using 'listof' for authors. Reworks formatting author fields.

            - Partial fix of messy resolver value deduplication.

            - Rename builtin shadowing 'file' to 'fileobject'.

            - Replace '_meowuri' with 'uri' to not shadow module.

            - Use 'force_meowuri()' to convert str to MeowURI.
              Call 'force_meowuri()' if exceptions message is not interesting.

            - Rename function and update docstrings.

            - Improve robustness of 'MeowURIParser.parse()'.
              Adds fixes and improved robustness to 'MeowURIParser.parse()'.

              Structures of lists and/or tuples nested deeper than one level was
              not handled properly. It now should be able to accept just about
              any combination of arguments, like for instance;

                  mp.parse('a')
                  mp.parse('a', 'b')
                  mp.parse(['a', 'b'])
                  mp.parse(['a', 'b'], 'c')
                  mp.parse(['a', 'b'], 'c', ['d'])
                  mp.parse(['a', 'b'], 'c', (['d'], 'e', ['f', ['g', 'h']]))

              The alternate solution would be to restrict how this method is being
              called to some expected usage, which might actually make more sense,
              but since this is intended to be a user-facing "parser", this extra
              ruggedness is not _entirely_ misplaced.

            - Rework use of the 'ExtractorRunner' class.
              Removes function 'run_extraction()'. Modify data provider.

              Adds creating an instance of 'ExtractorRunner' when instantiating
              the 'MasterDataProvider'. This way the same runner is used during
              the program execution, as intended with the recent changes to the
              'ExtractorRunner'.

            - Remove unused function 'suitable_extractors_for()'.

            - Uppercase module attribute '_master_data_provider'.

            - Always warn if requesting unavailable extractors.

            - Use instance of MeowURI as 'meowuri_prefix'.
              Adds using instances of MeowURI as 'meowuri_prefix' in plugins.
              Refers to [TD0133] on inconsistent use of MeowURIs.

            - Use instance of MeowURI as 'meowuri_prefix'.
              Adds using instances of MeowURI as 'meowuri_prefix' in analyzers.
              Refers to [TD0133] on inconsistent use of MeowURIs.

            - Use instance of MeowURI as 'meowuri_prefix'.
              Adds using instances of MeowURI as 'meowuri_prefix' in extractors.
              Refers to [TD0133] on inconsistent use of MeowURIs.

            - Remove TODO-identifiers from log messages.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0133].

            - Reimplement not filtering required slow extractors.
              Adds back lost functionality of filtering of "slow" extractors.

              If 'ExtractorRunner.exclude_slow' is true, "slow" extractors that
              are not explicitly requested are excluded.
              Slow extractors, like the 'TesseractOCRTextExtractor' will not be
              included unless explicitly required by including the class in the
              list passed to the 'ExtractorRunner.start()' method.

            - Remove unused function 'filter_meowuri_prefix()'.

            - Remove unused 'keep_slow_extractors_if_required()'.
              Removes leftover function 'keep_slow_extractors_if_required()'.

              This was forgotten and the functionality was left unimplemented
              after adding the 'ExtractorRunner' class in commit
              e28325341ddf892ab8a032e406d835331c93c154.

            - Extract 'MeowURI.matchglobs()' into function.
              Extracts the complex parts of 'matchglobs()' into separate function.

            - Import 'FileObject' from 'core'.

            - Rework the 'ExtractorRunner' class results storage.
              Implement calling a callback when storing results.

              This was partly implemented and probably forgotten.
              This change allows passing the data to something else than the
              "session repository", which will be useful for the stand-alone
              extraction runner.

            - Inline 'get_extractor_runner()'.

            - Use direct imports in unit tests.

            - Remove superfluous 'NameTemplateField.__init__()'.
              Removes unused init in the NameTemplateField class and subclasses.

            - Remove unused 'NameTemplateField.transform()'.

            - Remove unused methods 'evaluation_function()'.
              Removes unused method from 'GenericField' class and subclasses.

              This seems to never have been used in any way.  Original intent
              not clear; best remove and start over with something that actually
              solves actual current problems.

            - Remove unused exception 'ConfigReadError'.

            - Remove unused brute force search.
              Removes (skipped) old brute force search of date/time-information.

            - Add '__slots__' in the 'FileObject' class.
              Since it is used a lot of dict keys, this might be worthwhile.

            - Add 'BaseAnalyzer._evaluate_mime_type_glob()'.
              Moves MIME-type glob evaluation to new class method.

              For possible use by inheriting class.
            - Add class 'FilenameDelta'.
              Adds a new simple container class 'FilenameDelta' in 'renamer.py'.

            - Add new class 'ProviderRunner'.
              Extracts parts of 'MasterDataProvider' into new class 'ProviderRunner'.

            - Include text source in stand-alone extraction.

            - Rework YAML loading functions.
              Extracts function 'load_yaml()' from 'load_yaml_file()'.


            Fixes
            - Add handling 'EOFError' in 'BasePersistence'.
              Adds re-raising both 'ValueError' and 'EOFError' as 'KeyError'.

            - Fix warnings on missing 'multivalued' metainfo.
              Adds missing 'multivalued' entries in 'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor'.

            - Fix crash after 'request_any_textual_content()'.
              Fixes crashing after raising AttributeError when requesting text.

              Caused by assumption that the repository would not return lists of
              'DataBundle' instances. This should be fixed properly in [TD0175].

              Adds regression test '0016_list_all_c'.

            - Fix inconsistent behaviour of replacements.
              Fixes inconsistencies in "post-processing" replacements.

              Solved by doing the replacements in order, starting with the
              longest replacement string. Given replacements:

                  'The'    -> 'the'
                  'To The' -> 'to the'
                  'To'     -> 'to'

              The replacements are done in this order;  'to the', 'the', 'to'

              This same solution could also be used to solve [TD0152].

            - Fix incorrect defaults in integration runner help.

            - Clean up 'cli/common.py'. Add unit tests.

            - Clean up exception handling in 'has_permissions()'.

            - Clean up 'TesseractOCRTextExtractor' unit tests.

            - Use consistent Unicode notation. Cleanup tests.

            - Clean up 'rename_file()'. Add unit tests.

            - Clean up joining paths in 'unit/constants.py'.

            - Minor changes to human-readable repository contents.
              Fixes shadowing variable names and adds numbering generic MeowURIs.

            - Fix path passed through 'syspath()' twice in 'io.delete()'.

            - Fixes bug in mapping persistence keys to files.
              Fixes bugs where some files were not included in 'keys()'.

              Adds using separate function '_basename_as_key()' that does
              proper removal of the "prefix" and "separator", along with testing
              that the basename does in fact start with the "prefix".

            - Fix cache and persistence errors.
              Handles uncaught exceptions related to cache and persistence.

              When changing the format of the pickled data, all sorts of things
              fail.  Some exceptions were not handle properly and others did not
              provide useful information about the exception.

            - Fix crash when running '--dump-meowuris --debug'.
              Fixes crash running '--dump-meowuris --debug'.

              caused by assumption that multiple providers may be mapped
              to a single MeowURI, which is no longer true.

              Also adds sorting the listing within the provider sections,
              separated by newlines.

              Adds integration "smoke tests" to detect this bug.

            - Do not use magic number in regression runner.
              Fixes using a magic number to indicate a captured exception.

              Replaces returning -10 failed tests with setting a boolean attribute
              in the 'TestResults' class. This also includes other changes required
              to facilitate this.

            - Fix bad matching of 'image/vnd.djvu'.
              Fixes 'image/*' matching too many MIME-types in OCR text extractor.

              The 'TesseractOCRTextExtractor' was used for 'djvu' ebooks because
              of the MIME-type glob matching too much. This is fixed by explicitly
              listing different image types.

            - Fix 'BrokenPipeError' when piping to pager.
              Fixes exceptions raised by 'colorama' when piping out to a pager.

            - Fix checking tty before running 'prompt_toolkit'.
              Adds checking that stdin is a tty. Previously checked stdout.

              Even though previous check probably worked most of the time it
              is better to reflect the assertions in 'prompt_toolkit/input.py';

                  class StdinInput(Input):
                      """
                      Simple wrapper around stdin.
                      """
                      def __init__(self, stdin=None):
                          self.stdin = stdin or sys.stdin

                          # The input object should be a TTY.
                          assert self.stdin.isatty()

              One check is also moved so they are all contained in 'prompt.py'
              which works as a wrapper around 'prompt_toolkit'.

            - Fix all analyzers were included in delegation.
              Fixes bug where all analyzers were always included in delegation.

              After noticing a strange slowdown in the regression tests, I ran
              a shell script that produced output like the following;

              The slowness was introduced after fixing the filtering of "slow"
              extractors, revealing another bug.
              The 'MasterDataProvider' did not pass the list of specific analyzers
              to run which caused the analysis to include all analyzers every time.
              This resulted in running potentially really slow analyzers like the
              'ImageAnalyzer' (that in turn requests data provided by the
              'TesseractOCRTextExtractor') EVERY time that ANY analyzer data was
              requested.

              This is now fixed by simply adding back a commented out line ..

            - Fix exception handling in stand-alone extractor.

            - Remove no-op super-calls in extractor classes.


2018-02-01  [autonameow v0.5.4]
            Start of major overhaul (yes, again..) of overall architecture.
            This version adds some new features and fixes a lot of bugs, does
            cleanups, etc.  Still very much a work in progress. A lot of major
            changes is coming up next.

            Additions
            - Add (WIP) rework of overall architecture.
              Adds initial rework of "data pipeline" as per [TD0142].

              A new subsystem is added to handle top-most level data requests.
              The 'MasterDataProvider' class is not completed. It is intended
              to take data requests passed as a FileObject instance and a
              MeowURI.  (I.E. data for a certain file, matching a certain
              identifier)

              If the data is not stored in the repository, the appropriate
              provider (extractor/analyzer/plugin) should be tasked with
              gathering the data.  If successful, the requested data is stored
              in the repository.  Store any other data, gathered as a corollary
              as well.  E.G. if running 'exiftool' to get a specific field, DO
              NOT discard other fields, keep them to save on calls..

              If the data IS stored in the repository, return it directly.

            - Add option '-l' to the unit runner.
              Adds option for running the tests that failed during the last
              run.  Requires 'pytest'; the runner exits if 'pytest' is not
              available.

            - Add option '--force' to 'delete-python-caches.sh'.
              Adds option to skip the warning prompt when deleting cache files.

            - Add new option '--list-in-sources' to 'todo_id.py'.
              Adds a new flag for listing information on TODOs in the sources.
              Prints id, shortened file path and todo text for any found TODOs,
              sorted by ids.

            - Add 'devscripts/lint_python.sh'.
              Adds 'pylint' wrapper script, configuration file and tests.
              Updates 'devscripts/README.md'. Note that the configuration file
              'pylintrc' still needs some work to be useful.  Currently, the
              amount of messages is just too much to handle.

            - Add new option '--timid' to manually confirm each rename.

            - Implement coercing and formatting multiple values.
              Adds calling coercers format through 'listof()'.
              Example usage:

                formatted_list = types.listof(types.AW_STRING).format(raw_list)

            - Implement 'FileObject' class ordering operators.
              Implements 'FileObject.__lt__()' and 'FileObject.__gt__()'.

              Uses string comparison of the full absolute paths.
              Objects of other types are always "less" than a 'FileObject'.

            - Add "smoke tests" for stand-alone extractor.

            - Add message style "section".
              Adds a new formatting style "section" to the 'msg()' function.
              Also adds missing unit test for the "heading" style.

            - Add various extension/MIME-mappings.
            - Add partial implementation of "timid mode".

            - Add integration tests for text file consistency
              Checks style violations, whitespace, line separators, etc.

            - Add decorator 'log_func_runtime()'.
              Adds decorator function for logging runtime of methods/functions.

            Changes
            - Rename test runner scripts;

                'common_runner.sh'      -> 'run_all_tests.sh'.
                'integration_runner.sh' -> 'run_integration_tests.sh'.
                'unit_runner.sh'        -> 'run_unit_tests.sh'.
                'regression_runner.sh'  -> 'run_regression_tests.sh'.

            - Remove functionality for Linnaeus University course 1DV430;

                - Remove 'run-tests-and-update-wiki.sh'.
                - Remove 'check-wiki-report.sh'.

                - Remove function 'get_timestamp_from_basename()'.
                  Integration test function 'get_timestamp_from_basename()' was
                  used for extracting and reformatting date/time-information
                  from filenames for use as markdown headers in the wiki test
                  reports.

                - Remove exporting 'AUTONAMEOW_WIKI_ROOT_DIR'.
                  Environment variable 'AUTONAMEOW_WIKI_ROOT_DIR', exported
                  from 'setup_environment.sh' is used by various scripts that
                  automated generation of documentation required by the
                  Linnaeus University 1DV430 course.

                - Remove option flag '-u' from 'run_all_tests.sh'.
                  Removes option for adding test reports to the project wiki.
                  If this kind of functionality would ever be needed again, it
                  will be under different circumstances and best be
                  reimplemented from scratch.

            - Add explicit return values from test runners.
              Adds returning exit codes that correspond to tests failing.

            - Add filtering commits in 'update_changelog.py'.
              Adds filtering function 'is_blacklisted()' along with unit tests.

            - Remove version from regression test configs.
              Removes the 'COMPATIBILITY' section and version from config
              files.  Only three regression test cases (probably) need this
              section.  This commit deletes the rest to avoid having to
              continuously update them with every new program version.

            - Use 'file-magic' instead of 'python-magic'.
              Updates the documentation and notes on which "magic" module to
              use.

            - Create 'AUTONAMEOW_TESTFILES_DIR' if missing.
              Adds creating directory for test logs if missing in
              'setup_environment.sh'.

            - Remove 'MultipleTypes.__call__()' default value.
              Makes little sense to forego the tiny bit of provided type
              safety there is..

            - Modify regression runner verbose output.
              Print "PASS" and "FAIL" instead of "P" and "F".

            - Add logging "post-processing" options.
              Adds early return and additional logging of "post-processing"
              options.
              Return early to reduce indentation. Add more logging of loading
              of "post-processing" options from configuration file so that a
              badly named section does not lead to confusion, like what just
              happened to me ..

            - Cleanup 'ProviderRegistry.__init__()'.
              Moves debug logging to separate method. Copy incoming dict.

            - Only run specific analyzer in 'MasterDataProvider'.
              Modifies "delegation" to only run specific analyzers.
              Previously all available analyzers was always executed.
              Now only the loop iteration "provider" should run.

            - Display current file name with interactive prompts.
              Adds current file name to interactive prompts. Various cleanup.

            - Remove unimplemented condition in configurations.
              Removes constantly failing unimplemented conditions with
              "expression", like:

                  'extractor.metadata.exiftool.EXIF:DateTimeOriginal': 'Defined'

              References [TD0015].

            - Factor out 'try_load_option()' to new class.
              Adds a new class 'ConfigurationOptionsParser'.
              Factors out method 'ConfigurationParser._try_load_option()' into
              separate class.
              This seems to break the "0003_filetags*" regression tests but
              ONLY when run all regression tests with the regression test
              runner and not when running the respective command-lines
              manually.  Might be cause to inadvertently sharing state across
              test cases through the regression test runner.

            - Move method '_try_load_persistence_option()'.
              Moves method '_try_load_persistence_option()' to separate class.
              Method is moved to the new 'ConfigurationOptionsParser' class.
              Also adds unit tests and new TODO [TD0160] on improving
              validation and setup of various working directories.

            - Modify output format of stand-alone extractor.
              Modifies formatting to use headings for files, results in
              sections.  Also removes unused option dictionary entry
              'show_version'.

            - Fix MIME-type to extension mapping for 'html.gz'.
              Modifies MIME/extension-map to strip 'gz' from uncompressed HTML.

              Seems like files downloaded (by browsers? wget?) from the web
              uses some part (which?) of the HTTP headers to figure out a file
              extension for the destination filename.

              Seems like files tend to be saved with a 'html.gz' or 'htm.gz'
              extension even though the files are not compressed, which _might_
              have to do with the above mentioned HTTP header information;
              content-type? content-disposition?

            - Refactor 'todo_id.py' and gather more information.
            - Remove unused function 'suitable_plugins_for()'.
            - Show file name with field candidate selection.

            - Modify operating mode conflict resolution.
              Adds reverting to "less safe" defaults in case of conflicts.

              Instead of disabling "batch" if either "interactive" or "timid"
              is enabled, the "batch" mode now overrides any interactive mode.

              I.E. if starting with '--timid --batch', the '--timid' option
              will be dropped. Likewise, starting with '--interactive --batch'
              will ignore the '--interactive' option.

            - Remove broken unit test.
              The 'Autonameow' class should only be used as a context manager.

            - Rework regression test rename assertions.
              Fixes regression tests broken after changed implementation.

              Refer to commit 7680873bb6be9658dc5462a7461018f4c05ccf0a

              Adds TODO [TD0158] on testing the "skipped rename" assertions.

            - Rework regression test monkey-patching.
              Fixes regression test monkey-patching of the rename method.

              Previously, even files that were skipped because the new name was
              equal to the old name was counted as renamed files.  These are
              listed in the regression tests 'asserts.yaml'.

              This commit reworks this to at least solve some of the issues,
              but also causes breakage of existing regression tests that now
              produce false negatives.
              Changing the regression tests to not count a skipped file as a
              rename makes much more sense anyway, so it is a change in the
              right direction.

            - Pass option to 'FileRenamer.__init__()'.
              Moves passing options 'dry_run' and 'mode_timid' to class init.

              Since a single instance of the 'FileRenamer' class is to be used
              during program execution, it might make sense to set it up once.

            - Factor out renaming files to new class.
              Extracts method 'Autonameow.do_rename()' to new class.

              This seemed like a good move while starting to implement "timid
              mode".  Will also probably be useful when implementing "history"
              ability to better track renames and persist changes.

            - Refactor the 'ProviderRegistry' class.
              Removes duplicate methods, completes TODO-list item [TD0147].

            - Refactor finding providers from MeowURIs.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0147].

            - Query repository from the 'TemplateFieldDataResolver'.
              Adds querying the repository instead of the dynamic data
              provider.

            - Show more regression test information with '-v'.
              Adds showing test descriptions along with names in verbose mode.

            - Remove redundant exception handling.
              Removes redundant exception handling in 'AbstractTextExtractor'.
              These exceptions are either caught by the 'ExtractorRunner'
              caller or only serves to log a warning and re-raise the
              exception, which results in duplicated errors at different log
              levels.

            - Remove catching 'NotImplementedError'.
              Removes except 'NotImplementedError' in
              'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor'.
              This seems to be a leftover from very old code, nothing should be
              able to raise this exception from here. And if this were the
              case, an enclosing try/catch-block in the 'ExtractorRunner'
              catches it.

            - Fix continuous prompts if resolver fails.
              Reworks the brittle interactive section to not loop infinitely.

            - Disable incomplete interactive MeowURI prompt.
              Disables broken MeowURI prompt.
              The preceding 'interactive.select_field()' call returns instances
              of 'FieldDataCandidate' while 'interactive.meowuri_prompt()'
              returns instances of the 'MeowURI' class. Both functions also
              return a singleton 'Choice.ABORT' if the user aborts.

            - Cleanup output of stand-alone extraction.

            - Cleanup 'ISBNMetadata.authors' property setter.
              Inverts conditional. Adds reference to TODO-list item [TD0112].

            - Handle case of malformed authors in ISBN metadata.
              Adds handling a special case of malformed authors in ISBN metadata.

            - Move integration tests between suites.
            - Remove unused 'metainfo()' method parameters.

            - Remove superfluous extractor imports.
              Removes importing 'metadata' and 'text' in 'extractors/__init__.py'.
              This import seemingly does not have any effect and seems to be a
              leftover from experimental changes introduced when restructuring
              the module hierarchy in commit
              0df0ef91f45f6e39aeec15a6a58b09e93281c695.

            - Factor out '_handle_file()' into new class.
              Moves contents of 'Autonameow._handle_file()' to a new class.
              Adds a new class 'FilesContext' in 'core/context.py'.
              The contents of 'Autonameow._handle_file()' is moved to
              'FilesContext.handle_file()' without substantial functional
              modifications.
              This is motivated by future changes, where files within the same
              "context" are handled together in a batch. It also mitigates the
              growing complexity and length of code in the 'Autonameow' class.

            - Rework strings in 'constants.py'.
              Fixes inconsistent use of string constants. Adds tests.

            - Use 'isinstance()' instead of comparing 'type()'.
            - Remove class method 'BaseAnalyzer.__str__()'.
            - Modify 'BaseField.__bool__()'.

            - Have coercion classes to return None by method.
              Modifies implicit None returned by failed type coercions.

              Type coercion classes use common methods to raise exceptions
              in cases of failed coercion and/or normalization;
              '_fail_coercion()' and '_fail_normalization()'.

              This commit adds returning the return value from these method
              (None) instead of the previous implicit returning of None by
              reaching the end of the scope from which the exception raising
              method was called.

            - Simplify return in 'request_any_textual_content()'.
              Simplifies testing if return value is None.

            - Rework mapping provider classes to MeowURIs.
              Consolidates mapping MeowURIs to provider classes.

              Removes functions 'map_meowuri_to_$PROVIDER()' that duplicated
              functionality, now handled by '_get_meowuri_source_map()'.
              The module attribute dicts storing classes under their respective
              MeowURIs are all renamed to 'ProviderClasses' for easier access
              by this new function.
              Also fixes some confusion concerning number of classes mapped to
              a single MeowURI. Two provider classes returning the same
              identifier string from class method 'meowuri_prefix()' is now
              treated as an invalid state, enforced by an assertion.  Adds
              various other fixes and modifications related to these changes.

            - Disable returning datetime from 'DocumentAnalyzer'.
              Disables returning data from '_get_datetime_from_text()'.

              This and possible other other analyzers return results as both
              dicts and lists of dicts all mixed up.
              This should be straightened out and made more consistent.
              The data collection is disabled for now and should be reworked.

              References TODO-list item [TD0102].

            - Disable returning datetime data from 'TextAnalyzer'.
              Disables returning data from 'get_datetime()'.

              This and possible other other analyzers return results as both
              dicts and lists of dicts all mixed up.
              This should be straightened out and made more consistent.
              The data collection is disabled for now and should be reworked.

            - Remove testing as to not clobber mapped classes.
              Removes cautious checks intended to prevent clobbering mapped
              classes.
              The identifier strings returned by the classes are intended to be
              unique so a collision should be treated as a invalid state.

              Adds assertions in place of the removed tests.

            - Cleanup method 'provider_for_meowuri()'.
              Simplifies method 'ProviderRegistry.provider_for_meowuri()'.

              Removes lenient argument handling with assertions and various
              other readability improvements.

            - Remove checking for empty candidates in resolver.
              Replaces test for empty candidates dict with type assertion.

            - Use consistent return values from test runners.
              Adds returning consistent exit codes from test runners.

                EXIT CODES:   0         All tests/assertions passed.
                              1         Any tests/assertions FAILED.
                              2         Runner itself failed or aborted.

              This fixes previous commit that risked overflow and returning
              success (0) if 256 tests/tasks/whatever failed.

            - Modify handling of "generic fields" in analyzers.
              Adds fixes to handling of "generic fields" in analyzers.

              The generic fields were accessed in a try/catch 'AttributeError'
              clause in the repository as to not crash completely when random,
              inconsistent data was passed in.

              Hack fixes in '_add_results()', used by analyzer classes to store
              data in the repository allowed removing the try/catch in the
              repository.  However, this is still in great need of improvements
              and possibly a complete rewrite.

              Adds TODO [TD0146] on reworking "generic fields" and possibly
              bundling multiple fields in some type of "records".

            - Define '__all__' in 'util/misc.py'.
              Should have been added earlier as 'util/__init__.py' imports '*'.

            - Rework imports in 'disk/__init__.py'.
              Replaces specific imports with importing '*' and defining
              '__all__' to control what will be included.

            - Remove unused methods from (WIP) subclasses of 'BaseField'.

            - Rename variable in '__main__.py'.
              Renames ambiguous variable 'path' to 'SELF_ABSPATH'.

            - Add translating strings to generic field classes.
              Modifies specifying generic fields in provider 'FIELD_LOOKUP'.
              Instead of listing the generic field subclasses directly, which
              requires importing the module; specify the generic field classes
              as simple strings and "translate" these to classes in the
              respective provider "runner".
              This might be more robust to future changes and also allows
              further experimentation with reworking generic fields and
              integrating the concept of records.

            - Prefer 'dict()' over '{}' for empty dictionaries.
              Replaces instances of ' = {}' with ' = dict()'.  Motivated by
              easier grepping by differentiating format strings containing '{}'
              from empty dictionary literals.

            - Cleanup 'ProviderRegistry.provider_for_meowuri()'.
            - Cleanup stand-alone extractor.
            - Use '_' for unused variables when unpacking.
            - Remove unused attribute 'Record._weight'.
            - Rename 'lint-bash-scripts.sh' to 'lint_bash.sh'.
            - Rename all 'collect_results()' to 'store_results()'.
            - Move debug logging to 'if __debug__' branches.

            Fixes
            - Assert that third-party functionality is available before use.

            - Add '-t' flag to 'mktemp' calls.
              Adds arbitrary prefixes with the '-t' flag to all calls to 'mktemp'.

              These were not required on my primary MacBook Pro that is running
              macOS High Sierra version 10.13.2 and BSD 'mktemp' dated
              "December 30, 2005".  However, my secondary MacBook Pro runs OSX
              10.9.5 and even though the 'mktemp' man page specifies the same
              date and has the same contents, this version of 'mktemp' errors
              out if not given the '-t' flag and a prefix.

            - Add 'XXX' to 'mktemp -t' template.
              Adds a number of 'X' to the 'mktemp' template.
              This is apparently required by the GNU coreutils v8.25 version.
              From the manpage:

                TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecutive 'X's in last
                component.  If TEMPLATE is not specified, use tmp.XXXXXXXXXX,
                and --tmpdir is implied.

            - Unit tests
                - Fix broken unit tests.

                - Fix 'PdftotextTextExtractor' cache test setup.
                  Moves setup of caching speeds out of module scope.

                - Add 'MultipleTypes' type assertion and unit tests.

                - Add unit tests for field parser class attribute.
                - Skip unit tests if 'guessit' is missing. Add assertion.
                - Skip unit tests if 'PIL' is unavailable.
                - Skip unit test if 'unidecode' is unavailable.
                - Skip unit tests if 'isbnlib' is unavailable.
                - Skip unit tests if 'colorama' is not available.
                - Refactor and add missing field parser unit tests.

            - Fix formatting lists of candidate values.

            - Fix bug in configuration parser.
              Fixes default options dict being modified across regression
              tests.  Seems to solve problem of state not fully reset between
              regression test cases caused by various design flaws..

            - Fix inconsistent use of MeowURIs.
              Partial fix. Adds references to [TD0133].

            - Fix invalid generic field class in lookup dict.

            - Fix bug introduced in commit 62690425fc720276314af
              Fix invalid handling of None results in 'FilenameAnalyzer'.

            - Various fixes to (WIP) "streaming" data extraction.
              Have the 'ExtractorRunner' class run only "requested" extractors.

              Previously, it would run all extractors and use any extractor
              classes passed in as the "requested" argument only to override
              any extractors excluded due to being marked as "slow".

              This caused duplicate results to be stored in the repository.
              When the 'MasterDataProvider' was queried for data not in the
              repository, unrelated extractors was executed, resulting in
              unexpectedly duplicated data which messed up following requests.
              It is assumed that the "CrossPlatForm" file system extractor only
              saves one instance of "mime_type", for instance.

              Now the 'ExtractorRunner' runs only explicitly requested
              extractors, also tweaking data structures passed back to
              analyzers after requesting "global" repository data.

            - Fix handling None results in 'FilenameAnalyzer'.
              Fixes data requests returning None being coerced to empty
              strings.

            - Fix regression runner filtering with '--get-cmd'.
              Fixes bug where '--get-cmd' ignored filtering option '-f'.

            - Fix bad method call in stand-alone extractor.
              Providers 'metainfo()' method no longer accepts '*args'.

            - Fix inconsistent format of error log messages.
              Fixes inconsistent inclusion of exception message in log messages.

            - Fix repeated calls to 'displayable_path()'.
              Stores and re-uses result of first call to 'displayable_path()'.

            - Fix not returning correct choice from interactive.
              Fixes not returning expected value when user aborts with ctrl-c.

            - Fix using 'len()' to test if sequence is empty.
              Replaces several instances of 'if len(x) > 0' with 'if x'.

            - Fix mixed types of return values.
              Adds returning consistent types in various functions/methods.

            - Mass removal of unnecessary 'else' after 'return'.
              Fixes a lot of unnecessary 'else'-clauses after 'return'.

            - Fix major bug in 'ExtractedData'.
              Fixes serious bug in 'ExtractedData'. Fix namespace.

              The 'ExtractedData' instances would be shared when called
              multiple times from the same "wrapper_tag_lookup" dictionary.
              This commit adds a hack fix class method that uses 'deepcopy' to
              make a copy of the instance before calling and returning it.

              The type "wrappers" are renamed to "coercers" to avoid namespace
              issues with instances of 'ExtractedData', that also are referred
              to as "wrappers".


2017-12-31  [autonameow v0.5.3]
            Bug fixes, refactoring, some new features.
            A lot of improvements to utility scripts used during development
            as well as various testing tools, runners and actual tests.

            NOTE: This version changes the configuration syntax ---
                  config files written by previous version will *NOT* work!

            See the git log for all changes and detailed descriptions.

            Additions:
            - Add new option '--list-rulematch'.
              Adds a new option to display additional information on rule
              matching.  References TODO-list item [TD0135].

            - Add new post-processing option 'simplify_unicode'.
              Adds a new configuration option to strip Unicode
              accents/diacritics.  This adds a new entry to the
              'CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING' section;

                  CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING:
                      simplify_unicode: True

              Current default is True if left unspecified, This option enables
              converting Unicode symbols with accents/diacritics to plain ASCII
              or other equivalents, if possible.

            - Add 'devscripts/vulture.sh'.
              Adds wrapper script for running 'vulture'.

            - Add 'devscripts/todo_grep.sh'.
              Adds a simple grep wrapper for searching the sources for TODOs.

            - Add partial (WIP) still mostly broken interactive field select.

            - Add tests to the "Source Code" test suite.
              Adds testing that certain files are not added to the git repo.

            - Add various new integration tests.
            - Add 'devscripts/lint-bash-scripts.sh'.
              Wrapper for 'shellcheck' for ding static analysis on all bash
              scripts. Uses different settings for certain kinds of scripts.

            - Add human-readable total integration test execution time.
              Display time in hours, minutes and seconds in addition to
              just milliseconds,

            - Add global statistics to the integration runner.
              Adds showing final combined statistics for all test suites.
              Writes intermediate test results to a temporary file in order to
              solve the mess of sharing variables between sourcing/calling
              scripts in various subshells, etc.
              This also disables converting the test results to HTML by calling
              'run_task()' that was removed in a previous commit, leaving this
              use behind.

            - Include release date in output of '-v --version'.
              Also adds TODO-item [TD0145] on automating tasks related to
              releasing new versions, like updating the newly added
              'version.RELEASE_DATE'.

            - Add logging warning of bad 'NAME_TEMPLATES' type.
              Previously, if the config parser got non-dict 'NAME_TEMPLATES',
              they would be silently skipped without notifying the user.
              The user should be notified of bad syntax in their configuration.
              Actually, it would probably be better to fail even more
              explicitly for cases like these.

            - Add (iffy)(WIP) alternative unit test runner.
              Adds a somewhat incomplete alternative unit test runner.
              The new 'unit/__main__.py' allows running the unit tests as:

                  PYTHONPATH=autonameow:tests python3 -m unit

              Compared to the current runner script 'unit_runner.sh', this
              method could include filtering out specific test suites.
              Note that this is still somewhat incomplete, some tests fail
              in mysterious ways, possibly related to paths and mocking.

            - Add option '-f' to integration test runner script.

              Adds a new option '-f' to 'integration_runner.sh'.

                -f [EXP]   Execute scripts by filtering basenames.
                           Argument [EXP] is passed to grep as-is.
                           Scripts whose basename does not match the
                           expression are skipped.

            - Add limiting size of cache files.
              Implements ability to limit the size of cached files.
              Limits are checked every time data is written to the cache,
              which probably should be reworked at some future point.
              When the cache file size exceeds the limit, the n oldest items
              are removed from both RAM and disk. The number n is currently
              half the number of items, so if the cache contains 100 items, the
              50 oldest are removed when the cache file size exceeds the limit.
              It would probably make more sense to check the cache size at
              instantiation or possibly when the cache leaves the scope, using
              the context-manager protocol.
              This completes TODO-list item [TD0101].

            - Add basic statistics on renamed/skipped/failed.
            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Changes:
            - Improve and fix the regression runner.
              Adds various improvements and fixes to the regression test runner.
              Modifies existing options and adds additional selection options.
              Command-line use should be simpler and more consistent.

              1. Tests are selected by criteria defined with the "Test Selection"
                 options. If none are given, all loaded tests are selected.

              2. Actions selected with the "Actions to Perform" options are
                 performed on the selected tests.

              Adds option '-f'/'--filter' for selecting tests by matching the
              test name (dirname) with globs, I.E. asterisks matches everything.
              Adds option '--run' that is enabled by default but only executed
              if no other actions are enabled.
              Modifies option '--get-cmd' to no longer accept positional
              arguments, this is now done with the "Test Selection" options.

            - Add caching path computation in 'BasePersistence'.
              Adds storing results of '_persistence_dir_abspath()'.
              Actual speed increase seems to be pretty substantial for repeated
              lookups. Run-time of tests in 'test_persistence_cache.py' halved.

            - Simplify validating config 'NAME_TEMPLATES'.
              Joins checking if defined/empty with the type-check and collapses
              duplicated check for empty strings that raise the same exception.

            - Allow configuration without any rules.
              Removes failing configuration validation if rules are missing.
              Also adds additional regression tests for trivial smoke testing
              configurations containing only the 'COMPATIBILITY' section.

            - 'CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING' --> 'POST_PROCESSING'
              Replaces configuration section for "post-processing" options.
              Renames section 'CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING' to 'POST_PROCESSING'.

            - Rename key 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS' to 'FILESYSTEM'.
              Renames configuration dict key 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS' to
              'FILESYSTEM'.

            - Replace 'NAME_FORMAT' with 'NAME_TEMPLATE'.
              Replaces all instance of "name format" with "name template".
              The configuration name templates was referred to as both
              "name template" and "name format" in the sources, configuration,
              documentation, notes, etc.
              These inconsistencies are now fixed.
              The name template is used to_format_the file name.  And the
              format_of the file name is determined by the name_template.

            - Strip whitespace in config 'NAME_TEMPLATES' keys.
              Fail if the name template key is only whitespace.

            - Print top-level exception tracebacks in the regression runner.
            - Add ability to negate regression runner glob matching filter.
              Modifies the regression runner '-f' option.
              If the glob pattern starts with '!' the matching is negated.

                E.G.  'f*'  matches 'foo' but not 'bar'
                while '!f*' matches 'bar' but not 'foo'

            - Pass '-OO' to interpreter in runner script.
              Adds using Python interpreter option '-OO' in 'bin/autonameow.sh'.
              From 'man python3':

                  -O    Turn on basic optimizations.
                        Given twice, causes docstrings to be discarded.
                  -OO   Discard docstrings in addition to the -O optimizations.

              This change is mostly experimental. Basic measurements show that actual
              performance improvements are marginal at best. While some use-cases run
              10-20% faster with the optimizations enabled, it is still not clear if
              this is worth sacrificing assertions and debugging facilities.
              If one actually was to try to improve the performance, this is not the
              way to go about it.
              The main motivation is rather experimenting with conditional execution of
              (known from profiling) expensive operations in "if __debug__:" conditions.

            - Refactor getting candidates from the resolver.
              Refactors queries to the resolver for field candidates.
              Moves converting the candidates (data dicts) to string representations
              to the resolver class. This also adds returning the values wrapped in a
              'FieldDataCandidate' class. This is currently only used by functions in
              the interactive module.
              This and many related things are **VERY HACKY** and should be reworked.
              At least for now, this prevents crashing.

            - Add/modify MIME-type to extension mappings.
            - Remove use of and sourcing 'common_utils.sh' from the
              integration runner.
              Inlines a modified 'run_task()' that does not attempt to handle
              aborting the running task, because it did not work.
              This also sources the test suite scripts instead of evaluating
              ('eval x') them. This change is part of adding a global counter
              and attempting to solve shared state between all integration test
              scripts in the mess of sourcing/"evaling".

            - Move the 'disk' module to 'util'.
              Moves 'autonameow/core/disk' to 'autonameow/util/disk'.
              Might make more sense to keep functionality related to I/O
              out of the 'core' module.

            - Rename unit test files to reflect package/module hierarchy.

            - Add shared integration test utility function.
              Adds function 'bulk_assert_test()' for less duplicated code.
              One line using this function would replace several multi-line
              statements.
              For example;

                      'bulk_assert_test "/foo/bar" e f r'

              Is equivalent to three separate assertions with messages, etc.
              This should help to clean up a lot of duplicate code in the
              integration tests.

            - Simplify tests by using 'bulk_assert_test()'.
              Replaces multiple assertions with calls to 'bulk_assert_test()'.

            - Add returning from 'sanity'-functions if optimized.
              Adds returning early from 'sanity' functions if not '__debug__'.
              Intended to possibly mitigate the fact that assert statements are
              skipped in optimized mode, but calls to these home rolled
              functions that wrap assertions might not be detected and removed
              properly when running in "optimized" mode.

            - Move test config files to 'test_files/configs'.
            - Show custom replacements only in verbose mode.

            - Complete rework of the 'Configuration' class.
              Moves "parsing"/validation to a new 'ConfigurationParser' class.
              Finishes TODO-list item [TD0014].

            - Refactor field parsers. Add additional unit tests.
              Modifies how field parsers handle validation/evaluation of lists.
              Adds class attribute 'ALLOW_MULTIVALUED_EXPRESSION' that controls
              how validation ('validate()') and evaluation ('evaluate()')
              handles single or lists of expressions.
              A field parser class that has 'ALLOW_MULTIVALUED_EXPRESSION' set
              to False not validate any expression given as lists.
              If 'ALLOW_MULTIVALUED_EXPRESSION' is True, the field parser will
              convert any non-list expression to a list before validation.
              This moves any list checking from the class specific methods
              returned by 'get_validation_function()' and
              'get_evaluation_function()' to the base class 'validate()' and
              'evaluate()' functions, respectively.

            - Rework the 'Rule' class and rule conditions.
              Adds various Changes to rules, rule parsing and rule conditions.
              Allow rules with no conditions. These will always "evaluate true"
              but with zero score (and weight), effectively making them go
              unused.
              This is motivated by simpler testing and moving towards hopefully
              less convoluted code related to parsing and instantiating the
              configuration, rules, rule conditions, etc.
              Less assertions randomly strewn about also makes unit testing a
              bit easier; assuming that a single entity handles validation and
              parsing, a lot of assertions and '__init__()' type-checking can
              be removed.

            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Fixes:
            - Add skipping ISBN metadata missing some fields.
              Adds skipping ISBN metadata missing both authors and publisher.
              Also fixes bug where empty authors were not detected properly.
            - Adds various cleanup and fixes to global logging state.
              Shared logging state is still not handled properly. Mocking some
              critical tests works but is a workaround rather than a solution.
            - Add validating boolean configuration fields.
            - Rework exception handling in 'rules.py'.
              Fixes inconsistencies and cleans up rule exception handling.

            - Fix wrong key used in 'maps_field()'.
              Fixes bug in 'maps_field()' due to using the wrong key in dict lookup.
              This is a leftover from when removing the 'ExtractedData' class that
              had a property (or function (?)) named 'field_map'.
              This was simply translated to a dict lookup using a key with the same
              name, but the key actually used by providers was 'mapped_fields', so
              accesses would always fail.
              The function 'maps_field()' would always return False due to this bug.

            - Fix git error messages shown in version info.
              Fixes bug causing git error messages to be included in output
              when running with '-v --version'.

            - Various cleanups and fixes to all bash scripts.
            - Fix 'partition_basename()' returned empty tags.
              Used by the 'FiletagsAnalyzer' to extract tags from filenames.
              Whitespace between tags and the end of the string was not
              stripped correctly which resulted in empty tags being returned.
              This is fixed by stripping whitespace from extracted tags and
              filtering out any None or empty tags.

            - Use direct and/or local imports in unit tests.
            - Remove execute permission from 'autonameow.py'.
              Changes permissions of 'autonameow.py' from 755 to 644.
              Fixes likely leftover from way back when this file contained the
              main entry point to the program.  This file can not be executed
              stand-alone and should not be marked as executable.
            - Fix matching bug in 'devscripts/todo_id.py'.
              Fixes bug where multiple TODO IDs on one line was not found.
              Only the last ID was returned for lines like;

                  given='# TODO: [TD1337][TD1338] Implement baz.',

              This is fixed and new unit tests that verifies the matching.

            - Fix None publishers added by 'DocumentAnalyzer'.
            - Fix whitespace in 'msg()' heading width.
            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.


2017-12-04  [autonameow v0.5.2]
            Bug fixes, various refactoring and reworked test code.

            See the git log for all changes and detailed descriptions.

            Additions:
            - Add a lot of missing unit tests.
            - Add additional data validation in types 'format()' methods.
            - Add 'hypothesis'-based tests 'unit/test_property_encoding.py'.
            - Add 'hypothesis'-based tests 'unit/test_property_fieldparsers.py'.
            - Add 'hypothesis'-based tests 'unit/test_property_types.py'.
            - Add option '-c' to 'unit_runner.sh'.
              Adds optional coverage reporting with 'unit_runner.sh -c'.

            - Add function 'get_persistence()'.
              Adds "public" interface for getting a persistence mechanism.

            - Add option '--last-failed' to the regression test runner.
              Adds option for only running tests that failed during the last run.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0123].

            - Add (WIP) string distance functions.
            - Add improved "fuzzy" ISBN metadata de-duplication.
            - Add blacklisting ISBN numbers that failed metadata queries.

            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Changes:
            - Various improvements to the regression test runner.
            - Refactor a lot of the unit tests.
            - Rework structure of the test code.
            - Add 'FilenamePostprocessor' class to 'builder.py'.
              Moves inline procedure post-processing the filename to new class.
            - Removes unused function 'get_abstract_extractor_classes()'.
              Added directories 'tests/unit'. 'tests/integration' to go along
              with 'tests/regression'.

              - Removed common 'unit_test_' prefix from unit test code.
              - Removed 'integration_test_' prefix from integration test code.

              Also modified the integration test "suites" which no longer can
              be executed as stand-alone scripts.

              A lot of scripts are changed due to complications when handling
              sourcing and paths of bash scripts. It is not really possible to
              get the absolute path of the current script that works in all
              cases; running the script from the same directory, using a
              relative path, absolute path, through a symlink, etc..

              This commit adds a simpler solution where one script exports
              global environment variables that are used by the other scripts.
              This is handled by the new 'setup_environment.sh'.

              This new arrangement means that integration test suites no longer
              can be executed as stand-alone scripts.
              The complexity and workarounds just isn't worth the hassle.

              Integration tests should be executed with 'integration_runner.sh'.

            - Remove the 'AnalysisRunQueue' class.
            - Remove the 'GenericQueue' class.
            - Rework running extractors in 'extraction.py'.

              Adds new class 'ExtractorRunner' to 'extraction.py'.

              Reworks filtering extractors, but is essentially the same as the
              now deleted 'start()' function with some filtering functions
              factored out and mostly using sets instead of lists for storing
              the extractor classes.

            - Have 'unit_runner.sh' use 'pytest' if available.

              Modifies 'unit_runner.sh' to use the available test runner.
              Prefer 'pytest' but use 'unittest' if 'pytest' is not installed.

              If running with the '-w' option, 'pytest' as well as 'pytest.html'
              must be installed, otherwise the program exists with status 1 and
              an error message.

            - Add optional path argument to 'get_persistence()'.

              Works around confusion around which persistence path is used.
              Currently inconsistent depending on the use-case..

              If the main 'Autonameow' class sets the active configuration with
              'config.set_active()', any valid persistence path in the user
              configuration file is used.  Otherwise, the default path defined
              in 'constants.py' is used.

              This problem tells of broader architectural issues..
              When calling 'get_persistence()' from 'regression_runner.py',
              before 'config.set_active()' has been called, results in one
              persistence path being used at the start of
              'regression_runner.py' execution and another at the end,
              after having called 'Autonameow' main the first time..

            - Refactor coloring replacements in 'builder.py'.
              Adds refactoring of utility functions and unit tests.

            - Remove the unimplemented 'FilesystemAnalyzer'.

            - Call middle parts of MeowURI "children".
              Renames the 'MeowURINode' class to 'MeowURIChild'
              Changes other usage of a "node" to "child",
              "nodes" to "children".

              The reason is that a "node" probably is a better describes for
              all parts of a MeowURI, which might be joined in an abstract base
              class with this name.
              This is also more similar to basic computer science terminology.

            - Move MeowURI parsing to separate class.
              Extracts parts of the 'MeowURI' class into new 'MeowURIParser'.

            - Add searching full text in chunks in the analyzers.
            - Improve searching for ISBN-numbers in the 'EbookAnalyzer'.

            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Fixes:
            - Fix broken import in 'epubzilla.py'.

            - Add type assertion in 'extraction.collect_results()'.
              Asserts that extractors return data of type dict.

              This is pretty much guaranteed by the extensive new unit testing
              of extractors using shared test case base classes.

              Completes TODO-list entry [TD0106].

            - Fix resolver not stopping after finding match.

              Fixes bug caused by a missing 'break' in the resolver.

              This caused the loop that fetches and verifies data for specific
              name template field to go on, overwriting perfectly good data,
              causing the resolver to fail even when the requested data is
              valid and available.

            - Fix bug in name template field 'Tags.format()'.

              Fixes bug in the format method of the 'Tags' template field.

              The format-method worked fine when passed a list of strings, but
              when passed a single string, the string was split up and joined
              with the "between-tag-separator", causing "tag" to become
              "t a g", assuming a single space as "between-tag-separator".

              This commit fixes this by coercing the data to a list of strings.

              Added regression tests '0003_filetags_b' and '0003_filetags_c'
              that demonstrates this failure case.

            - Fix various bugs in field parsers found by 'hypothesis'-tests.

            - Fix bug in 'PdftotextTextExtractor'.
              Crash caused by calling 'strip()' when extracted text is None.

            - Fix bug in 'BaseAnalyzer._add_results()'.
              Fixes bug where lists was nested instead of simply added.

            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.


2017-11-18  [autonameow v0.5.1]
            Major refactoring and extensive rework of internals and tests.
            Added new regression test "framework" that will replace most of
            the tests in 'integration_test_rename.sh'.

            See the git log for all changes and detailed descriptions.

            Additions:
            - Add initial deduplication of values in the resolver.
            - Add (WIP) stand-alone content extraction 'bin/extract.sh'.
            - Add regression tests and runner 'tests/regression_runner.sh'.
            - Add 'BaseNullValue' and 'NullMIMEType' classes in 'types.py'.
            - Add verification to 'todo_id.py'.

              Adds additional features to 'todo_id.py'.

              * Adds option flag '-n'/'--next':

                  Print the next free (unused) TODO-list entry identifier.
                  I.E. the previous functionality. This is enabled by default,
                  and so the script can still be used in exactly the same way.

              * Adds option flag '-c'/'--check':

                  Checks that the sources does not contain completed TODO-list
                  entries or entries that are not in the TODO-list. And also
                  that entry IDs in the TODO- and DONE-list are mutually
                  exclusive.
                  Exits silently with status code 0 if all checks pass.

              * Adds option flag '--oprhaned':

                  Print entries that are in the TODO-list but not the sources.

            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'bin/run.sh' to 'bin/autonameow.sh'.
            - Refactor most extractor unit tests to use shared base classes.
            - Remove the 'ExtractedData' class.
            - Improved readability of log messages.
            - Remove text extractor 'PyPDFTextExtractor'.
              This extractor has been disabled for some time due to poor
              results.  It is now removed. Should probably be replaced with
              some other PDF text extraction method to provide an alternative
              to 'pdftotext' for cases where it is not available.
              But 'pdftotext' will have to do for now.
            - Remove everything related to 'PyPDF2'.
              Removes the 'PyPDFMetadataExtractor' and related.

              Removes the coercion type class 'PyPDFTimeDate' along with other
              code related to 'PyPDF', 'PyPDFMetadataExtractor' and leftovers
              from the previously removed class 'PyPDFTextExtractor'

              This removes the 'PyPDF' dependency entirely, which is reflected
              in 'install.md'.

            - Move package 'util/disk' to 'core'.
            - Move package 'autonameow/core/util' to 'autonameow/util'.
            - Factor out parts of 'Repository' into new 'ProviderRegistry'.
              Adds a new class 'ProviderRegistry' to handle keeping track of
              sources (extractors, analyzers, plugins) and registering partial
              MeowURIs.
              This was all previously handled in the 'Repository' class, which
              should only deal with storing data from now on.
            - Rework mapping MIME-types to extensions with new 'mimemagic.py'.
              Adds a 'MimeExtensionMapper' class in place of directory lookup.
              The new class is meant to provide a better interface to the
              'mimetypes' library as well as functionality for adding preferred
              extensions for specific MIME-types.

            - Remove caching in all text extractors except OCR.
            - Add partial separation of CLI-specifics from UI.
              Adds rework of module/package structure and imports.

              * Replaces calls to 'cli.msg()' with 'ui.msg()'.
              * Moves 'core/options.py' to 'core/ui/cli/options.py'.

              The 'ui' package is intended to provide an interface to any UI.
              Even if this is currently not relevant and future addition of an
              alternative to the only current command-line interface UI, would
              require reworking a lot of stuff due to incorrect assumptions;
              enforcing this separation at this stage improves readability.

              Note that code inside 'ui/cli' that needs to call 'msg()' does
              not call through the interface with 'ui.msg()', but instead uses
              the CLI-specific function 'cli.msg()' directly.

              Code that is outside of 'ui/cli' should call 'ui.msg()'.

            - Refactor constructing 'RuleCondition' instances.
              Moves constructing 'RuleCondition' instances outside of 'Rule'.
            - Remove 'BaseExtractor.__call__()'.
              Calling extractors like this no longer makes much sense when
              moving to separate methods of accessing the extracted data
              through 'extract()' and the additional information through
              'metainfo()'.

            - Remove 'sanity.check()'.
              Replaces uses of 'sanity.check()' with 'assert'.

              While cute, this function does not add any additional value and
              serves only to add unwarranted indirection and complexity.

            - Remove 'sanity.check_isinstance()'.
              Replaces uses of 'sanity.check_isinstance()' with assertions.

              Adds catching 'AssertionError' in the top-most exception handler.
              The 'AWAssertionError' class should probably be removed as it is
              now only used when inherited from by 'EncodingBoundaryViolation'.

            - Add 'cli/argparser.py'.
              Moves modifying the 'argparse.ArgumentParser' to a new file.

              Adds a shared public interface for getting the modified argument
              parser.  Avoids duplicating code in the autonameow 'options.py'
              and future changes to the regression test runner main.

            - Move 'BaseAnalyzer' and 'AnalyzerError' to new file.
              Adds a new file 'analyzers/common.py' to mirror the extractors.

              Moves classes out of '__init__.py' to a separate for consistency
              with the structure used by the extractors.

            - Modify analyzer run queue priorities.
              Prioritizes analyzers to run that providers of often used data
              first.
              This ranking is probably not even necessary and should be
              removed, but seeing as it is still here it might as well be a
              bit more sensible.

            - Remove passing analyzer results through callbacks.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0122].

              Replaces the callback-method with returning results stored in an
              instance attribute dict 'results'.

              The 'run()' method is reworked to call a new method 'analyze()'
              that does what 'run()' did previously, and then return the
              results.

              This changes is motivated by making it easier to follow what is
              going on and simplify the overall workings of the results
              collection, that is currently undergoing various refactorings.

            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Fixes:
            - Various bugs in the resolver causing crashes.
            - A lot of miscellaneous cleanup, removal of dead code, etc.
            - Modify returned value for empty 'FileObject' parts.
              Returns empty bytestrings for missing 'FileObject' parts.

              File name parts 'basename_prefix' and 'basename_suffix' now
              return empty byte strings instead of None for files that do not
              have the relevant part(s). That is, for instance; 'empty' has no
              extension.

            - Fix multiple sources was overwritten.
              Adds temporary fix to bug where multiple MeowURIs was clobbered.

              Multiple sources for a name template field in the configuration
              file would not be properly parsed in 'config/rules.py'.
              Only the last source would be used, clobbering the previous.

              This commit fixes this by storing the MeowURI sources in a list,
              which also required changes in the "resolver". These changes is
              temporary in that the resolver is a terrible mess, and must be
              cleaned up and/or rewritten in conjunction with reworking usage
              of the 'ExtractedData' class.
            - Catch exceptions thrown by failed imports.
            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.


2017-10-23  [autonameow v0.5.0]
            Various bug fixes and refactoring.

            NOTE: This version changes the configuration syntax ---
                  config files written by previous version will *NOT* work!

            Additions:
            - Add datetime field '{year}'.
              Completes TODO-list item [TD0038].
            - Extend and improve the 'MeowURI' class.
            - Add skipping invlaid exiftool metadata entries.
            - Add arbitrary max limits to bruteforce searches.
              Limit set by 'MAX_NUMBER_OF_RESULTS' in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add new extractor 'EpubMetadataExtractor'.

            Changes:
            - Add sorting authors when formatting the template field.
            - Use 'MeowURI' class functionality as per [TD0105].
            - Add caching '__str__' in the 'MeowURI' class.
            - Refactor unit tests.
            - Restructure source files, module/package hierarcy.
            - Improve parsing robustness in the 'MeowURI' class.
              Add a lot of improvements and fixes to the 'MeowURI' class.
              Add new stand-alone verification functions and a lot of unit
              tests.

            - Refactor main program entry point.
              Separates the CLI-specific main entry from the "real" main entry.

              Adds a new function 'real_main' that will be the _actual_ program
              entry point.

              This function is intended to be platform/interface-agnostic, in
              that it should be called by an outer interface-specific layer;
              like the CLI entry function 'cli_main'.
              The passed in options are also in an internal format (dict) as to
              not depend on any means of providing program options; argument
              parsers, etc.
              Default options are now defined in 'real_main' and checking
              option combinations is also handled here.

              This change also separates the 'argparse' CLI argument parsing
              from initializing the logging system.

            - Disable the 'PyPDFMetadataExtractor'.
              PyPDF somehow overrides default warning systems. Disable for now.

              It seems very difficult to disable warning messages emitted by
              PyPDF2 due to the way the library is designed. This, combined
              with the overall poor performance and the fact that the project
              is currently "unmaintained in the short term", this extractor is
              now disabled.

            - Add running all plugins if using '--list-all'.
              This works like the inclusion of "slow" extractors.
              Plugins that are referenced in the configuration are included.
              If any results should be displayed, as when running with the
              '--list-all' option, all available plugins are included.

            - Modify conventions for importing utility modules.
                - Use 'import genericfields as gf'.

            - Add new package 'cli'
              Move contents out of 'core/ui/cli/__init__.py'.
              Adds new file 'core/ui/cli/common.py'.

              Moves contents of 'core/ui/cli/__init__.py' to
              'core/ui/cli/common.py'.

              This package is intended to be the interface to multiple
              containing sub-packages that each implement different UIs.

              There is currently only a command-line interface, so this
              interface does not exist. BUT it might be good to implement the
              interface only once another UI is added and the real use and
              requirements are better known anyway.

            - Add new package 'disk' and split up utility functions.
            - Add sorting by MeowURIs when listing repository contents.
            - Add partial implementation of handling coercing lists.
            - Rework persistence and caching system.
            - Modify rule prioritization algorithm.
            - Wrap URIs from non-core with the 'MeowURI' class.
              Completes [TD0105] on integrating the MeowURI class.

            Fixes:
            - Fix 'git_commit_hash()' returning errors when PWD not in source
              root.  Adds temporarily changing the current working directory
              before running the Git subprocess that fetches the currently
              checked out commit.
            - Abort when stdin/stdout is not a TTY. Fix broken tests.
            - Fix crash due to uncaught 'PermissionError' in 'get_files_gen()'.
            - Handle crash in 'format_name_lastname_initials()'.
              Handles crashing because of unhandled 'IndexError'.
              This was caused by the author name "Steve Anson ... [et al.]".
              The periods would be stripped, leaving the empty string that
              would cause the 'IndexError' when accessing to get the first
              character.
            - Fix detecting compound last names in target format.

            - Fix crash. Add 'multivalued' to 'ExtractedData'.
              Fixes crashing (sanity check failure) when formatting tags.

              The name template field 'tags' is assumed to be a list, enforced
              by a sanity check assertion. This failed when the filename
              analyzer passed a single tag to the results.

              This is fixed by modifying the 'ExtractedData' class to allow
              coercing "multivalued" data. The relevant methods in the name
              builder and template field classes are also modified to handle
              multiple values differently; instead of passing a list of
              'ExtractedData' instances, a single instance of 'ExtractedData'
              now can contain a list of data.

            - Fix expression validation bug.
              Fixes bug where a valid boolean False would fail validation.

            - Fix uncaught exception when reading bad epub zip-files.
            - Fix auto-detecting coercer-class from a list of data.
              Assumes that all list entries are of the same type, which is very
              obviously incorrect a lot of times, but works good enough in
              practice.


2017-10-10  [autonameow v0.4.9]
            Includes changes to the configuration file syntax as well
            as refactoring and various fixes of existing functionality.

            Additions:
            - Add additional MIME-type to extension mappings.
            - Add 'util/checksum.py' with hashing functions.
            - Add attribute 'bytesize' to the 'FileObject' class.
              The attribute is evaluated only at first access, storing the
              result for future access.
              Uses 'UNKNOWN_BYTESIZE' if the stat-call fails, which might not
              be such a good idea ..
            - Modify hashing 'FileObject' instances.

              Adds using the "partial" cryptographic hash when hashing
              instances of 'FileObject'.

              When combined with the other attributes used in computing the
              hash, this addition greatly reduces the risk for unwanted hash
              collisions in practical usage.

              Although, this should probably still be extended with the WAY
              WAAY SLOWER method of hashing the entire file for critical
              applications.

            - Add 'makedirs()' to 'diskutils.py'.
            - [TD0103] Add class 'ISBNMetadata' to do ISBN "de-duplication".
            - Add 'remove_ignored_textlines()' to 'analyze_ebook.py'.
            - Implement 'get_edition()' in the 'FilenameAnalyzer'.
              Returns any found editions as integers wrapped in 'ExtractedData'
              instances.  This should be consolidated with similar pattern
              matching of probable editions in plain text done in the
              'EbookAnalyzer'.
            - Add attribute 'hash_partial' to 'FileObject'.
              This could be used for non-critical comparisons and generating
              practically unique identifiers. The only reason for hashing only
              parts of the files is performance.
            - Implement 'delete()' in the 'BaseCache' class. Adds tests.
            - Bind configuration field parsers to "generic" fields.
            - [TD0097] Add changing persistence options in the config.
              Adds a new section to the configuration file.

              This new section allow specifying paths for the caching system as
              well as the interactive prompt history.

                  PERSISTENCE:
                      cache_directory: null
                      history_directory: null

              If omitted or left empty, default values will be substituted.

              NOTE: Default values are always '/tmp/autonameow_cache' and
                    should be made platform-independent at some point.

            Changes:
            - Modify format of '--dump-meowuris' output.
            - Factor out getting MeowURI parts from modules.
              Moves getting MeowURI parts to functions with added
              error-checking.
            - Pass extractors 'FileObject', not bytestrings.

              Replaces bytestring extractor sources with instances of
              'FileObject'.
              Extractors have been passed sources as absolute bytestring paths.
              The 'FileObject' instance has the equivalent absolute path stored
              as an attribute, and hopefully provides additional advantages.

              This is motivated by replacing identifiers used by the caching
              system as keys into the cached data. When the extractors were
              passed only an absolute path to the source, they would have to
              make an extra call to get some kind of checksum from the path, to
              use as the cache key.

              By passing instances of 'FileObject', a reused method for getting
              a file hash can be utilized. This is probably the '__hash__'
              method or a separate hashing method in the 'FileObject' class.
            - Refactor unit tests.
            - [TD0098] Use 'FileObject' hash as cache keys.

              Fixes cache using absolute paths as keys when storing data.

              Adds using hashes provided by 'FileObject' as keys when caching
              data.  Replaces bytestring extractor sources with instances of
              'FileObject'.

              Extractors have been passed sources as absolute bytestring paths.
              By passing instances of 'FileObject', their hashing methods are
              implicitly utilized.

              This reduces the risk of retrieving wrong data from the cache,
              which could happen quite frequently with the old method,
              considering how for instance downloaded files often end up in the
              same directory, using some default basename.

            - Simplify output of '--version'.
              Now prints the bare version if not running with '--verbose'.

            - Add new section 'NAME_TEMPLATE_FIELDS' to config.

              Adds a new section 'Name Template Fields' where the user can list
              known good candidates for fields along with search patterns.

              For instance, the publisher field lists user-defined book
              publisher names along with a list of patterns that if matched,
              would be replaced with the publisher name.

              The default configuration contains the new section:

                  NAME_TEMPLATE_FIELDS:
                      publisher:
                          patterns:
                              FeedBooks:
                              - This book is brought to you by Feedbooks
                              - http://www.feedbooks.com
                              ProjectGutenberg:
                              - Project Gutenberg
                              - www.gutenberg.net

            - Add searching text for publisher in 'DocumentAnalyzer'.
              Adds searching with 'NAME_TEMPLATE_FIELDS' patterns.
              Uses the user-defined patterns in the configuration file.
              Example;

                  NAME_TEMPLATE_FIELDS:
                      publisher:
                          candidates:
                              ProjectGutenberg:
                              - Project Gutenberg
                              - www.gutenberg.net

              The publisher 'ProjectGutenberg' would be used if the document
              text matches any of specified patterns when used as
              case-insensitive regular expressions.

            - Add passing the 'Configuration' instance to all analyzers.
            - Modify configuration syntax and default config.
              Replaces name template field section 'patterns' with
              'candidates'.
            - Add skipping exiftool tags in 'IGNORED_EXIFTOOL_TAGNAMES'.
            - Replace paths with 'FileObject.hash_partial' in log messages.
            - Start integrating the 'MeowURI' class.
              Modifies configuration parsing to use 'MeowURI' instances.

              Adds (WIP) integration of the 'MeowURI' class.
              This should provide a couple of benefits:

              1. All MeowURI validation is handled by the class.
                 It is currently spread out everywhere, a lot of type-checking
                 and tests can probably be removed if the concept of a MeowURI
                 is well encapsulated by the class.
              2. Remove hardcoded strings.
                 Makes for hopefully easier future syntax changes.
              3. Better introspection, the MeowURIs themselves provide
                 information on what kind they are, what kind of resources they
                 refer to, etc. Should mean less redundancy.

              This commit also includes a bunch of other changes due to the fact
              that a lot of the unit tests had to be modified after these changes.
            - Move ordinal regular expressions to 'textutils.py'.
              Adds utility function 'compiled_ordinal_regexes()'.

              Adds utility function for getting compiled regexes for matching
              ordinals to 'textutils.py' and removes similar patterns from
              'analyze_filename.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Add various fixes and cleanup 'analyze_document.py'.
            - Add sanity checking types in 'Resolver'.
            - Fix crashing due to missing None-checks in 'FilenameAnalyzer'.
            - Improve robustness of 'unit_utils.py' functions.
            - Improve the caching system init and error handling.
              Adds creating the cache directory if it does not exist.
              Fixes uncaught 'CacheError' and  modifies the using extractors to
              not abort the extraction if the cache is unavailable.
            - Remove 'deepcopy' of rules in 'RuleMatcher'.
              This was necessary when the 'Rule' class kept scores and other
              state that would be modified between 'RuleMatcher' evaluations of
              different files. This is no longer the case, so this should not
              be needed and does in fact not seem to be needed after a cursory
              glance.
            - Fix 'ColumnFormatter' max column width.
            - Cleanup name formatting functions in 'textutils.py'.
            - Fix bug in calculating probability in 'DocumentAnalyzer'.
            - Add workaround for [TD0084] in 'exiftool.py'.
            - Disable adding redundant results in 'DocumentAnalyzer'.
              References TODO-list item [TD0102].
            - Add reworked (still somewhat WIP) 'pre-assemble-format'.
            - Fix bugs in searching filenames for probable editions.


2017-10-05  [autonameow v0.4.8]
            Adds first implementation of an "interactive" mode with a
            MeowURI-prompt. Contains major rework of the 'Resolver' and
            high-level program flow, which is still a work in progress.

            NOTE: This version changes the configuration syntax ---
                  config files written by previous version will *NOT* work!

            Additions:
            - Initial implementation of an interactive mode based on the
              'python-prompt-toolkit'.
            - Add custom assertion "sanity checks" that raises a special kind
              of exception intended for bug reports.
            - Initial abstraction of "MeowURIs" in the 'MeowURI' class.
            - Add Git submodule 'python-nameparser' to 'thirdparty/nameparser'.
            - Add functions to format full names to "LAST_NAME, initials".

              Example:  "Gibson Cat Sjöberg" is returned as "Sjöberg G.C."

              The 'format_name_lastname_initials' Function formats single names
              and 'format_names_lastname_initials' formats and sorts lists of
              names lexicographically.

            - Add color highlighting "post-processing replacements".

              Refactors 'colorize_quoted' into a more general function
              'colorize_re_match' that adds colors to parts of text that
              matches a given compiled regular expression.

              Modifies 'colorize_quoted' to simply pass 'colorize_re_match' a
              regular expression that matches anything within quotes.

            - Add utility 'ColumnFormatter' class to 'cli.py'.
              Utility formatter for printing columns of string.
              All column widths are set to the widest entry in any column.

            - Adds a new command-line option '--dump-meowuris'.

              Dump all MeowURIs registered to the "Repository" at startup.
              Some sources require explicit inclusion and might therefore not
              be included. Combine with  "--debug" for more information.

            - Add caching system with pickle-backend.
            - Add caching ISBN metadata requests.
            - Add caching text extracted by the 'PdftotextTextExtractor'.
            - Add caching text extracted by the 'PyPDFTextExtractor'.
            - Add caching text extracted by the 'TesseractOCRTextExtractor'.
            - Add new generic fields.
              'GenericAuthor',  'GenericPublisher' and 'GenericHealth'

            - Add a new extractor class 'JpeginfoMetadataExtractor'.

              Returns a new type of generic field; 'health', that represents
              the integrity or 1/corruption of a file as a float in range 0-1.

              It also returns a related boolean result 'is_jpeg' that could be
              used to verify file types, ensure quality and detect corrupt
              files.  Which is very useful when dealing with jpegs ..

            - [TD0042] Implement the '--quiet' option.
            - Add 'devscripts/write-default-config.sh'.
              Script for writing the default configuration to YAML-file.
              Writes the config in 'core/config/default_config.py' to
              'test_files/default_config.yaml'.

            Changes:
            - Modify the configuration file format in a non-trivial way.

              Adds storing the 'Rules' in a dictionary instead of list.
              The new dictionary is keyed by the old 'description'-field.

              Example of the OLD format:

                  RULES:
                  -   CONDITIONS:
                          extractor.fs.xplat.basename.full: foo_pdf.md.pdf
                      DATA_SOURCES:
                          extension: extractor.fs.xplat.basename.extension
                      NAME_FORMAT: foo_pdf.md.{extension}
                      description: test_files foo_pdf.md.pdf
                      exact_match: true
                      ranking_bias: 1

              Example of the NEW format:

                  RULES:
                      test_files foo_pdf.md.pdf:
                          CONDITIONS:
                              extractor.fs.xplat.basename.full: foo_pdf.md.pdf
                          DATA_SOURCES:
                              extension: extractor.fs.xplat.basename.extension
                          NAME_FORMAT: foo_pdf.md.{extension}
                          description: test_files foo_pdf.md.pdf
                          exact_match: true
                          ranking_bias: 1

              This should make the configuration file easier to read for humans.

            - Moves 'autonameow_version' to a new section in the config.
            - Modify contents and formatting of '--version' output.
            - [TD0081] Add 'pyexiftool' as a Git submodule.
              Replaces 'wrap_exiftool.py' with a 'pyexiftool' submodule.
            - Add convention of importing 'constants.py' as 'C'.
            - Rename constant variables in 'constants.py'.
            - Remove the 'AbstractMetadataExtractor' class.
              Modify 'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor' and 'PyPDFMetadataExtractor'
              to inherit directly from 'BaseExtractor' class.
            - Move 'ExtractedData' to new file 'extracteddata.py'.
            - Various changes to how "sources" register "MeowURIs".
            - Prepend 'extractor' to the 'ExiftoolMetadataExtractor' MeowURI.

                  Previous MEOWURI_ROOT = 'metadata.exiftool'
                   Current MEOWURI_ROOT = 'extractor.metadata.exiftool'

            - Modify overall handling of "MeowURIs".

              Instead of hard-coding a "MEOWURI_ROOT" in the source classes,
              this new method uses the Python module hierarchy to construct
              default MeowURIs.

              It is still possible for source classes to override either parts
              or the entire MeowURI.

              The new convention is to always include the type of sources in
              "source-specific" MeowURIs.

              The first part is either 'extractor', 'plugin' or 'analyzer'.

              Example:  'extractor.metadata.exiftool.EXIF:DateTimeOriginal'

              This makes a clear distinction between the specific MeowURIs and
              the "generic" URIs, which will be simpler; 'metadata.DateCreated'

            - Refactor retrieving paths in 'diskutils.py'.

              Substitutes 'get_files' with the similar generator version
              'get_files_gen'.

              Adds a new class 'PathCollector' to store the "globs" that are
              to be converted to bytestrings". The class was intended to act
              as a container or encapsulated namespace.

            - Refactor configuration parsing and validation.
            - Add new 'namebuilder' package.
              Move 'namebuilder.py' to 'namebuilder/builder.py'.

            - Separate name template fields from "generic" fields.

              Moves the content from 'core/fields.py' and moves it to the two
              new files 'namebuilder/fields.py' and 'model/genericfields.py'.

              The original 'core/fields.py' is deleted.

            - Add initial implementation of verifying name template data.

              Adds checking if subclasses of 'NameTemplateField' is
              "compatible" with data collected by the resolver.
              This is part of moving towards providing the name builder with
              validated data.
              The name template field classes attribute 'COMPATIBLE_TYPES' list
              the "coercion"/type-wrapper types whose data format can be used
              to populate the relevant field.

            - Modify default configuration.
              Moves options from section 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS' to "post-processing".

              Moves the following options from the 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS' section:

                  'lowercase_filename': False,
                  'uppercase_filename': False,
                  'sanitize_filename': True,
                  'sanitize_strict': False

              .. to the 'CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING' section.

            - Modify "generic" MeowURIs.

              Renames constants for MeowURI roots. Adds 'MEOWURI_ROOT_GENERIC'.

              Modifies the format of "generic" MeowURIs from the previous
              'metadata.generic.author' to 'generic.metadata.author'.

            - Split PDF text extractors into separate files.

              Separates 'pdf.py' into 'pypdf.py' and 'pdftotext.py'.

              In order to fit with the current scheme of devising MeowURIs from
              the module/package names in the hierarchy, these two extractors
              should be separated into different files.

              This makes source-specific queries possible, I.E.
              'extractor.text.pypdf' or 'extractor.text.pdftotext'; which was
              previously impossible because the query 'extractor.text.pdf'
              would return text produced by either of these two extractors.

            - Refactor unit tests add shared utility functions.
            - Rename 'PyPdfTextExtractor' to 'PyPDFTextExtractor'.
            - Rework how data is passed from/to analyzer classes.
            - Rename 'ImageOCRTextExtractor' to 'TesseractOCRTextExtractor'.

              Renames the source file from 'ocr.py' to 'tesseractocr.py'.

              Part of moving towards the new scheme of devising MeowURIs from
              the module/package names in the hierarchy.

              The new names distinguish this exact extractor, as opposed to the
              old names that was intended to work with any OCR backend.

            - Disable 'PyPDF2' text extraction because of poor results.
            - Modify colors, content and formatting of many messages.
            - Add method 'as_string' to 'ExtractedData'.

              This works around having to "round-trip" like so:

                  assert isinstance(ed, ExtractedData)
                  s = ed.coercer.format(ed.value)

              Now this does the same thing:

                  assert isinstance(ed, ExtractedData)
                  s = ed.as_string()

            - Add new package 'ui'. Move 'cli.py'.
            - Add returning probable extensions from 'FilenameAnalyzer'.

            Fixes:
            - Return None from 'Configuration.get()'.

              Replaces raising 'KeyError' with returning None for bad accesses.

              Fixes bug causing program crashing when the name builder calls
              'config.get(['CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING', 'replacements'])' and the
              configuration file does not contain these sections.

              The configuration usually substitutes default values to prevent
              this, but in this case it really should be up to the user to
              decide if any substitutions should be made.

            - Fix serious bug in 'ExtractedData'. Fix namespace.

              The 'ExtractedData' instances would be shared when called
              multiple times from the same "wrapper_tag_lookup" dictionary.

              This commit adds a hack fix class method that uses 'deepcopy'
              to make a copy of the instance before calling and returning it.

              The type "wrappers" are renamed to "coercers" to avoid namespace
              issues with instances of 'ExtractedData', that also are referred
              to as "wrappers".

            - Add various fixes to the 'GuessitPlugin'.
            - Add various fixes to the 'MicrosoftVisionPlugin'.
            - Add handling more date/time-information returned by 'exiftool'-
            - Fix crashing when some dependencies are unavailable.
            - Fix bugs in the type coercion classes.
            - Fix bugs and improve performance of the 'filter_paths' function.
            - [TD0086] Use one "SessionRepository" per autonameow instance.

              Adds a 'RepositoryPool' class to handle repositories.

              The active repository is registered to the start time and process
              ID registered by the 'Autonameow' class.
              This solution is pretty overkill but does solve the problem.
            - Fix various bugs and improve robustness of configuration parsing.
            - Prevent 'Resolver' adding sources for unused template fields.
            - [TD0004] Clean up text decoding.

            - Fix unhandled exceptions in 'populate_name_template'.
              Adds catching 'TypeError' at the call-site.
              The try/catch-block around 'name_template.format(**kwargs)' does
              not seem to catch any 'TypeError' exceptions caused by the
              keywords in kwargs not being Unicode strings.

            - Fix invalid data requests to generic text.
              Changes generic text content requests to 'contents.generic.text'.
            - Fix analyzers not expecting instances of 'ExtractedData'.
            - Fix crash due to missing None-check in 'pdftotext.py'.
            - Fix missing 'MEOWURI_LEAF' attribute in plugins.
            - Fix incorrect validation in the MIME-type field parser.


2017-09-20  [autonameow v0.4.7]
            Added custom "post-processing" replacements and case-changes.
            Bugfixes and refactorings.

            Additions:
            - Implement type wrapper classes 'format' methods and remove the
              'formatter' keyword argument.
            - Add generic fields.
            - Add improved date/time-parsing with utility functions.
            - Improve argument validation robustness for user-facing functions.
            - Add a new option for transforming filenames to all lower-case.

              Adds new configuration field under 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS'.

                  FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS:
                      lowercase_filename: false

              Default value is false.
            - Add option for transforming filenames to all upper-case.

              Adds new configuration field under 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS'.

                  FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS:
                      uppercase_filename: false

              Default value is false.

              If both 'uppercase_filename' and 'lowercase_filename' is enabled,
              then 'uppercase_filename' is (not really) arbitrarily ignored.
            - Add user-specified "post-processing" replacements.

              Uses pairs of regular expressions patterns and replacement string
              to perform last-minute replacements on the new file name.
              Example:

                  CUSTOM_POST_PROCESSING:
                      replacements:
                          \-\{2,\}+: '-'
                          \.{2,}: .
                          o[tk]: MEOW
                          gmail: mjaomjao

              1-2) Collapses repeating dashes and periods, respectively.
                3) Replaces either 'ot' or 'ok' with 'MEOW'.
                4) Replaces 'gmail' with 'mjaomjao'.

            Changes:
            - Add a new "to-string" method in the 'Repository' class.
              Means that the '--list-all' formatting has changed.
            - Modify text extractors 'meowuri_root' and common return method.

              The repository 'store' method (and '_store' method) handles too
              many specific cases, this is part of an effort to have non-core
              components use a more consistent format for the data to be
              stored.

              Instead of having the 'meowuri_root' be
              'contents.textual.raw_text' and returning the data "as-is" from
              the 'AbstractTextExtractor.excute()' method, this commit modifies
              the 'meowuri_root' of all text extractors to 'contents.textual'
              ('contents.visual' for the OCR-extractor..) and adds returning a
              dict from the 'AbstractTextExtractor.excute()', with 'raw_text'
              as the only key.
            - Modify the "MeowURIs" used by text extractors.

                  Previously:  'contents.textual.raw_text'
                  Changed to:  'contents.textual.text.full'

            - Modify terminal color scheme.
            - Rename 'PdfAnalyzer' to 'DocumentAnalyzer'.

              Having filetype-specific analyzers no longer makes any sense.
              The analyzer classes have been left behind while the overall
              overarching goals and surrounding architecture has changed.
            - Move getting a Unicode str representation of fields.

              Instead of having the 'Resolver' class gather data and then do
              formatting by calling the bundled wrapper and other contextual
              information, it should be more appropriate to let the "name
              builder" perform all formatting-related operations, as the name
              builder has access to user-defined formatting options.  Also, the
              name builder already performs very similar actions --- they
              should be consolidated and kept in one place.
            - Modify public 'Configuration' interface.

            Fixes:
            - Do not "rebuild magic" at every MIME-type test.
            - Improve reading version number from config.
            - Fix bugs in the utility function 'eval_meowuri_glob'.
            - Various fixes to 'Repository' methods.
            - Fix logic error in 'decode_raw' that effectively disabled it.
            - Fix crash when missing datetime-formatting options.

              Adds falling back to default 'DATETIME_FORMAT' options.
              If the configuration file did not specify the following options;

                  DATETIME_FORMAT:
                      date: '%Y-%m-%d'
                      datetime: '%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S'
                      time: '%H-%M-%S'

              .. the program would crash because no default values were used.
              If any of the 'DATETIME_FORMAT' options are missing, the
              following defaults, defined in 'constants.py', will be substituted:

                  DEFAULT_DATETIME_FORMAT_DATETIME = '%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S'
                  DEFAULT_DATETIME_FORMAT_DATE = '%Y-%m-%d'
                  DEFAULT_DATETIME_FORMAT_TIME = '%H-%M-%S'
            - Add 'PIL' to 'ImageOCRTextExtractor' dependency checks.
            - Fix intermittent bug in getting extension from MIME-type.


2017-09-11  [autonameow v0.4.6]
            A lot of refactoring for improved robustness and stability.
            Removes the 'pytesseract' dependency. Adds dynamic handling of
            missing dependencies.  Major rework of extractors and plugins.
            Refer to the git log for additional details.

            Additions:
            - Add new analyzer class 'EbookAnalyzer'.
            - Add git submodule 'epubzilla' for handling epub-files.
              This is still WIP, and will reqire a lof of fixing before use..
            - Add checking extractor class dependencies.
            - Add extracting timestamps in 'CommonFileSystemExtractor'.
            - Add improved logging system.
            - Add new analyer class 'FiletagsAnalyzer'.
            - Add mapping "sources" (plugins/extractors/analyzers) to
              "meowURIs" for looking up candidate sources classes from
              query strings.
            - Add requiring extractors based on "meowURIs" referenced by rules
              in the active configuration.
            - Add ignoring files listed in the configuration.

              Uses "globbing" similar to that of 'fslint', acting on full
              paths.  So that glob '.DS_Store' would not match any files,
              instead use '*/.DS_Store' to match all files called '.DS_Store'
              in any path.

              The ignored files are listed under the 'FILESYSTEM_OPTIONS' in
              the configuration.

              The user-specific ignore-patterns is added to a set of defaults
              that are listed in 'constants.py'.
            - Add a new file 'name_template.py' for placeholder fields.
              Still somewhat of a work in progress.
            - Add A new class 'Resolver' for handling data collection
              previously done in 'namebuilder.py'.
            - Add meowURI: 'filesystem.abspath.full'
            - Rework 'plugin_handler.py'. Run only referenced plugins.
            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Changes:
            - Remove state and modify calling extractor classes.
              Modifies extractors to not keep any state and simplifies use.
              Previously, the extractor classes was handed a data source at
              instantiation through the '__init__' method.  This meant that the
              classes first had to be "loaded" with a source before they were
              executed in a later step, when running the "queue".
              Extractor classes no longer require any arguments to the
              '__init__' method.  Instead, the data source is passed to the
              class 'execute'-method, through the '__call__' method.

                  Old way of extracting data:

                      extractor = DataExtractor(source)
                      result = extractor.execute()

                  New way of extracting data:

                      extractor = DataExtractor()
                      result = extractor(source)

              This also removes the "extractor run queue" as it no longer
              required with this new way of executing extractors.

              Extractors also stored data in instance variables such as
              'self._data'.  This is also removed -- extractors should be
              called as functions.
              Extractors should no longer keep any state between calls.

            - Consolidate methods for returning extractor results.

2017-08-18  [autonameow v0.4.5]
            Mostly non-functional improvements and refactoring.
            Rework of the internals for improved robustness and new features.
            Refer to the git log for additional details.

            Additions:
            - Add new type wrapper class 'PathComponent'.
              Passing parts of file names that could be empty, like a file
              extension that might be missing without considering the file name
              to be invalid, would trigger exceptions in the 'Path' type class
              that expected full absolute paths.
              This commit adds a new type class 'PathComponent' that accepts
              parts of paths and even empty paths, like that of a missing file
              extension.
            - Add requiring all extractors to be run if displaying any results.
              This should be reworked to handle cases where the configuration
              requires information from "slow" and normally excluded
              extractors.
              Normally excluded extractors should be included when they are
              required, not only when any results are to be shown.
            - Add optional list of required extractors.
              Adds optional argument 'require_extractors' to the 'start'
              method.
              The 'Extraction' class 'start' method can take an optional list
              of required extractor classes. If a extractor is "slow", it is
              not used if not explicitly required by inclusion in the
              'require_extractors' list.

            Changes:
            - Remove "get_*" methods from 'BaseAnalyzer'.
            - Add new extractor 'PlainTextExtractor'.
            - Move 'Rule' and 'FileRule' classes to 'rules.py'.
            - Modify field assignments to field parser classes.
              Uses the globs to catch some metadata fields. Especially
              'exiftool' fields such as 'PDF:Title' and 'XMP:Title' are matched
              by '*.:Title'.
            - Substitute a bad recursive function with a new common utility.
              Both the 'AnalysisResults' and 'ExtractedData' classes used a
              recursive function to count the number of contained items.
              One of these implementations was bad and returned bad counts.
              Add a single shared utility function used by both classes.
            - Rename 'AnalysisResults' method 'query' to 'get'.
            - Modify overall storage architecture.
            - Add a new 'Repository' class for storing all data.
            - Modify querying results in the 'RuleMatcher'.
            - Modify wrapping possibly empty path components.
              Use the new 'PathComponent' class for data that might be empty.
              The file extension might be missing and still be valid.
            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.

            Fixes:
            - A lot of unused code removed.
            - Fix 'PlainTextExtractor' returns text as list.
            - Fix "null" return form the 'Path' types. Raise exception instead.
            - Do not represent "null" for 'datetime' types.

              <BANE> Find a suitable "null" representation of a 'datetime'
                     object, by not representing it.  </BANE>

            - Add fixes to the 'PathType' class and its related tests.
            - Fix various extractor bugs.
            - Fix incorrect exception handling in extractors.
            - And a lot more --- refer to the git log for additional details.


2017-07-25  [autonameow v0.4.4]
            Mostly non-functional improvements and refactoring.
            Rework of the internals for improved robustness and new features.

            Additions:
            - Adds a new script 'devscripts/next_todo_id.py'.
              Returns the next free TODO-list identifier that hasn't been used
              in either the TODO-list ('TODO.md') or "done" list ('done.md').
            - Add missing unit tests.
            - First implementation of internal custom type system.
              Custom type "wrapper" classes are used to coerce data into
              certain types. Classes are instantiated and re-used as "filters",
              the data is simply passed through and not contained within the
              custom type classes.
            - Add a method '_normalize' to the 'RegexConfigFieldParser' class.
              To be used for normalizing "unwieldy" text which might hopefully
              make matching more intuitive when dealing with text that "should"
              match but doesn't due to Unicode symbols looking very similar..
              NOTE: Currently completely unused.
            - Add passing extractor results data through the 'Path' type.
              Also adds modifications to the 'FileObject' class to match these
              changes. The 'FileObject' fields that are used in the changed
              lines should already be in the "internal bytestring" format, and
              so passing the data through the 'Path' type class returns them
              as-is.
              However, the idea is that this is part of a overarching change in
              how types are handled throughout the program and this specific
              case might be revisited and simplified at some later stage.
            - Add a partial implementation of handling "raw" data safer.
              Data extracted by 'MetadataExtractor' classes is wrapped in type
              classes that provide validation and type coercion.
              This *might* be a viable way to convert unknown "raw" data to a
              internal representation with greater certainties regarding the
              data types and contents.
              This might also solve formatting and other related issues.
            - Add mapping type wrappers to "raw" data with
              'tagname_type_lookup' in Extractor classes.
            - Add function 'try_wrap' that attempts to wrap values.
              Uses a lookup table dict 'PRIMITIVE_AW_TYPE_MAP' to map the type
              of the given value to internal type wrapper classes.

            Changes:
            - Refactor and cleanup the 'Configuration' class.
            - Rework how parsers are mapped to "query strings".
            - Various refactoring of unit tests.
            - Modify fields for 'DateTimeConfigFieldParser'.
            - Add returning dummy, false-positive "True" incomplete parsers.
              Results in unimplemented field parser evaluation functions will
              always evaluate a condition to True. Uses lambda-functions.
            - Various changes to the 'FieldParser' classes and their mapping.
            - Removs the 'MetadataSourceConfigFieldParser' class.
              This field parser class does not follow the intended abstraction
              model where the parser classes are mapped to expected data types
              based on the "query string". The "metadata fields" could contain
              any type of data, and so this class does not work well with the
              rest of the current implementation.
            - Move functions related to extractors.
              Moves functions and module attributes to 'extractors/__init__.py'
            - Move functions related to analyzers.
              Moves functions and module attributes to 'analyzers/__init__.py'
            - Rename extractor classes to indicate use and type.
              Prepend 'Abstract' to abstract classes, 'Base' to base classes.
            - Adds getting valid query strings at run-time instead of constant.
              Part of moving towards collecting information about valid query
              strings at run-time instead of using predetermined constants.
            - Remove redundant methods in "results" container classes.

            Fixes:
            - Add handling unimplemented evaluation.
            - Improvements to condition validation and configuration parsing.
            - Fixed comparing 'datetime' object with/without timezones.
            - Fix hack import and instantiation of extractors.
              New functions for finding and importing extractor classes from
              suitable python source files helped eliminate ad-hoc imports.


2017-07-10  [autonameow v0.4.3]
            Mostly refactoring and improvements of the internals; parts that
            handle evaluation of rules and validating the configuration are
            rewritten and greatly improved.
            Includes changes to the configuration file syntax, as well as
            compatability tests that alerts that user of this and upcoming
            changes.

            Additions:
            - Add compatability checking the configuration file.
              The program version used to write the file is stored in the
              configuration, this is compared against the version of the
              running program.
            - Add testing 'FieldParser' class suitability with wildcards or
              "globs", similar to the "MIME type globs" used in the 'Extractor'
              classes and for evaluating MIME type conditions in the
              configuration file rules.
            - Add a new "--recursive" option for recursively collecting files
              from all subdirectories of a given path.
            - Add additional integration and unit tests.
            - Add new "Compatibility" integration test suite.
              Some of the tests from the "Command-Line Interface" test suite
              were moved to this new file. New tests were added as well.
            - Add a new 'RuleCondition' class.
              Represents a single condition contained in a configuration file
              rule.  Performs validation of incoming arguments and packages a
              condition to facilitate evaluation.
            - Add unique identifiers to TODOs in the code and the TODO-list.

            Changes:
            - Modify the configuration file syntax.
              The configuration now uses a "flatter" structure as follows;

              Previous, old syntax:
                  -   CONDITIONS:
                      contents:
                          mime_type: image/jpeg
                      filesystem:
                          basename: DCIM.*
                          extension: jpg

              New, "flattened" syntax:
                  -   CONDITIONS:
                      contents.mime_type: image/jpeg
                      filesystem.basename: DCIM.*
                      filesystem.extension: jpg

            - Refactor and cleanup the 'Configuration' class.
            - Rework rule evaluation, now uses the 'FieldParser' classes to
              evaluate conditions. Still a work in progress.
              The "rule matcher" uses the 'RuleCondition' class method
              'evaluate' to evaluating conditions.  The method delegates the
              evaluation to a referenced 'FieldParser' class, that is chosen
              based on the "query string".
            - Various bugfixes and refactoring.
            - Move towards the "new" high-level architecture, separating the
              "core" from "analyzers" and "extractors".

            Fixes:
            - Fix 'FileRule' scores was not reset properly after each file.
            - Fix inconsistencies in the configuration file syntax.
            - Various improvements to handling encoding.
            - Fix broken integration and unit tests.


2017-06-24  [autonameow v0.4.2]
            Includes first attempt at properly fixing encoding issues.  Also a
            lot of cleanup and refactoring.  Refer to the Git log for details.

            Additions:
            - Add unit tests for old code.
            - Add and rework existing unit test mocking functions.
            - Add 'tests/README.md'.
            - Add constant 'MAGIC_TYPE_UNKNOWN' to be used if detection fails.

            Changes:
            - Modify how extractor and analyzer classes are deemed suitable for
              a given file.
              Old method evaluated the given file MIME type against the MIME
              type blobs in each of the classes attribute 'handles_mime_types'.
              Suitability is now tested by a new class method 'can_handle' in
              the 'Extractor' and 'Analyzer' base classes.  The internal
              implementation is the same, but this change opens up for future
              overriding of the 'can_handle' method in each of the inheriting
              classes if they require additional testing.
            - Various code/filename fefactoring and cleanup.
            - Add initial attempt at fixing encoding issues properly.
                - Based on the solution used in the "beets" project, described
                  here:  http://beets.io/blog/paths.html
                - Add reusable functions for encoding/decoding at boundaries.
                - Start reworking code to adhere to the boundaries and keep
                  data encoding/decoding to a minimum within the program.
            - Fall back to a default file rule description if not provided.
            - Rework terminal coloring and modify logging colors.
            - Add initial refactoring of 'namebuilder.py'.
              Move rule matching functions from 'namebuilder.py' to a new file
              'rulematcher.py'.

            Fixes:
            - Improve the 'colorize' function and verify with unit tests.
            - Fix the 'colorize_quoted' function and verify with unit tests.
            - Handle case where results is a dict of dicts.
              Results are flattened and the label is prepended to the results.
            - Add proper handling of MIME type globs in the configuration.
            - Trivial improvements to some of the unit tests execution speed.


2017-06-17  [autonameow v0.4.1]
            This version marks the start of definitiely moving towards
            a redesigned and pretty much frozen high-level architecture.
            Includes major changes. Refer to the Git log for in depth coverage.

            Additions:
            - Improved error handling in the 'NameBuilder' class.
            - Add support for simple globbing in MIME comparisons.
              This is used internally and in the configuration file.

                  MIME to evaluate      Glob          Evaluates
                  ---------------------------------------------
                  'image/jpg'           'image/jpg'        True
                  'image/png'           'image/*'          True
                  'application/pdf'     '*/*'              True
                  'application/pdf'     'image/*'         False

            - Add program version in the configuration file for future
              compatability testing.
            - Add 'TODO.md', which will be the primary list of stuff to do.
              Also added 'done.md' for the completed TODO-list items.

            Changes:
            - Modified the configuration file syntax.
              NOTE: Incompatible with older versions.
            - Major restructuring of overall architecture.
              Move towards separating data extracting from data analysis.
                - Add data extraction handler class 'Extraction' that functions
                  similar to the 'Analysis' class. Builds a queue of
                  "extractors" suited for the given file, executes enqueued
                  extractors and collects the results.
                - Add "extractors" as classes inherting from 'Extractor';

                    - Extractor
                        - MetadataExtractor
                            - ExiftoolMetadataExtractor
                            - PyPDFMetadataExtractor
                        - TextExtractor
                            - PdfTextExtractor
            - Various changes in part of moving towards new architecture.
                - In progress moving of data extraction from "analyzers" to
                  "extractors".
                - Extracted data is passed to the 'Analysis' class and
                  subsequently the "analyzers".

            Fixes:
            - Numerous fixes and corrections.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.
            - Removed a lot of hacks added in order to deliver v0.4.0 on time.


2017-06-06  [autonameow v0.4.0]
            Final version used in the demonstration videos recorded 2017-06-06.
            Includes major changes. Refer to the Git log for in depth coverage.

              This is the first actually usable version! Still very much alpha.

            Additions:
            - Improved out printing with presets and coloring.
            - Added actual renaming of files. '--automagic' mode now
              renames files matched in the configuration file.
            - Add 'santizize_filename' from the "youtube-dl" project.
            - Various utility functions and related unit tests.
            - Add customizable date/time formats in configuration file.
            - Add parsing configuration file rules, conditions and sources.
              Parts of this still needs quite a bit of work.
            - Add 'extractor' package for content extractors that can be used
              by analyzers. Should reduce code duplication.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

            Changes:
            - Major restructuring of module hierarchy.
              All analyzers are moved to a new module 'analyzers' located at
              the same "depth" as the main 'core' module.  This is motivated
              by striving strict separation between the main program core and
              auxiliary modules that perform various tasks like data extraction
              and interaction with other systems.
            - Restructued internal data format. All crucial internal data
              structures are dervied from a reference 'RESULTS_DATA_STRUCTURE'.
            - Start move towards using callbacks to collect analyzer results.
            - Redesigned exiftool wrapper.
            - Abandon 'PyPDF' text extraction. Use 'pdftotext' exclusively.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

            Fixes:
            - Numerous fixes and corrections.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

2017-05-10  [autonameow v0.3.1]
            Insignificant changes of the core functionality. But major rework
            and improvements of the testing code, documentation and structure.

            Additions:
            - Include additional information on the environment in debug mode.
            - Add new option '--config-path' to allow specifying an alternative
              configuration file to use instead of the default configuration
              file at predetermined platform-specific locations.
            - Add shared library for the integration test scripts;
              'tests/integration_utils.sh', contains common utility functions
              used by bash test-scripts, like assertions, execution time
              measurement, logging, etc.
            - Add integration tests and integration test runner;
                - Add main integration runner 'integration_runner.sh'.
                - Add "Test Suite" test suite 'integration_test_tests.sh'.
                - Add "Command-Line Interface" test suite
                  'integration_test_cli.sh'.
                - Add "Documentation" test suite 'integration_test_docs.sh'.
            - Add directory 'devscripts' for developer tools and scripts.
                - Add experimental script 'list-imported-modules.sh'.

              Handles setting up paths and global variables that are exported
              to the environment.
            - Add unit test runner; 'unit_runner.py'.
              Wraps 'pytest' which is used to run all unit tests and export the
              test results report to a HTML file.
            - Add (work in progress) runner for ALL tests; 'common_runner.sh'.
              This script will run both integration tests and unit tests and
              produce a summary report which will be included in the project
              wiki page, alternatively uploaded to GitHub pages.

            Changes:
            - Remove matching of rule field 'filename_in_filetags_format'
              in 'RuleMatcher'. Motivation is limiting project scope.
            - Remove prototype integration test; 'tests/run_integration_1.sh'.

            Fixes:
            - Various fixes and corrections to the main source and unit tests.
            - Various fixes and corrections to the utility scripts.

            - Add simple handling of NotImplementedError exceptions thrown in
              the abstract analyzer base class when an unimplemented field
              attribute getter is called.
            - Fixed various failing unit tests.


2016-12-19  [autonameow v0.2.2]

            Additions:
            - Include exiftool wrapper 'pyexiftool'.
                  http://smarnach.github.com/pyexiftool
                  https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool
              Simply copied in place for now. Dependecies should be handled
              properly, as git submodules, via pip or similar mechanism.
            - Add wrapper script 'run.sh' to act as a main entry point.
            - Start using exiftool in the pdf analyser.

                - Operating mode is either "automagic" or "interactive".
                  Default mode is the (safer (?)) "interactive mode".
                - Options for which actions to perform, for example:
                  "prepend datetime" or "rename" (unimplemented) are separate.
            - Add simpler method for getting fields from analyzers.
            - Change main color in the ASCII art header from yellow to blue.
            - Various changes to the 'namebuilder' class. Still far from done.

            - Fix bug where the message to use '--help' to display help was
              displayed even when '--help' was used.
            - Display  message if the yet unimplemented feature "prepend
              datetime" is enabled.
            - Fix bug in 'prettyprint_options' by explicitly wrapping

            Additions:
            - Improved inline documentation/docstrings.
            - Add priority to the analysis run queue execution.
                - Analyzers are assigned a priority number 0-1, stored in the
                  class variable 'run_queue_priority'.
                - Analysis with a higher number are executed before those
                  with a lower number.
            - Add rule field 'prefer_title'.
              Specifies which title to use, similar to 'prefer_datetime'.
            - Add detecting filename in "filetags" format.
                - Add method 'filetags_format_filename()' to 'FileObject' that
                  returns boolean True if the filename is in "filetags" format.
                - Add unit tests for 'filetags_format_filename()'.
            - Add rules to 'config_defaults.py' for testing.
            - Add matching of rule field 'filename_in_filetags_format' in
              'RuleMatcher'.

            Fixes:
            - Fix error caused by missing 'string.letters' attribute with
              Python 3. Use 'ascii_letters' for now. Should be fixed.
            - Fix broken unit tests.
            - PIL exception logging debug message caused crash.
            - Fix guessit import statement.

2016-08-28  [autonameow v0.2.0]

            Additions:
            - N/A

            Changes:
            - Migrate project to Python 3.5.
              Drop Python 2 support entirely for simplicity.
              Backwards compatibility fixes might be added at some future time.

              version "2to3-2.7 2.7 January 2012". Some passed unchanged.

            Fixes:
            - N/A


2016-08-19  [autonameow v0.1.8]

            Additions:
            - Add unit tests for 'options.py'.
            - Add a 'NameBuilder' class for assembling new names.
              Fills out the empty template specified by a matching rule with
              data from analysis results.
            - Extend and improve the 'RuleMatcher'.
            - Add dynamic listing of Analyzer classes.
                - Store all analyzer classes in '_ALL_ANALYZER_CLASSES'.
                  The classes are added if their name ends with "Analyzer".
                - Adds function 'get_analyzer_classes' to access the above list.
                - Adds function 'get_instantiated_analyzers' to get a list of
                  analyzer objects.
                  Note that these are instantiated with a None 'FileObject'.
            - Store relevant file mime types in the analyzers themselves.  Add
              a new field 'applies_to_mime' that can be a string, a list of
              strings or None, which means the analyzer should be used
              regardless of file mimetype.

            Changes:
            - Rename the command-line option '--ignore-before-year' to
              '--ignore-to-year'.

            - Improve function 'arg_is_year'.
            - Remove stub "action" classes 'AbstractAction' and 'RenameAction'.
            - Do not pass filter instances to the analyzers.  Filters were not
              used anyway, instead do the filtering as a separate step after
              the analysis.
            - Analyzers do not execute their analysis at instantiation.
                - Use new method 'run()' to start the analysis.

            Fixes:
            - Fix incorrect number of arguments expected for options
              '--ignore-from-year', '--ignore-years' and '--ignore-to-year'.
            - Rule matcher name regex tests file basename.
            - Fix no matching rule caused crash.

            - Extend the "filename partitioning" to include a date-/timestamp.
              Add and/or modify unit tests for extracting 'filenamepart_ts'.

            Changes:
            - Remove the 'Results' class in 'analysis.py' and substitute a
              plain dictionary instead.
            - Rename the actual value key in the results dictionary returned by
              analyzers to "value", instead of the previous "datetime" and
              "title" for datetime and title respectively.

              attribute names and structure.
            - Update how the 'FilenameAnalyzer' gets tags from filenames.
              Now uses the "partitioned filename" methods in 'FileObject'.


2016-07-22  [autonameow v0.1.3]

            Additions:
            - Add a very fancy ASCII art logo, created with "figlet".
              Displayed only when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Add tests for functions in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Move function 'filetype_magic' to the utility file system
              functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Move responsability for basic file name operations to the utility
              file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Tests for getting file name extensions, file basename, etc.
            - Tests for extracting "filetags" tags.

            Changes:
            - Modify startup "banner" text contents and overall appearance.
            - Improve 'match_special_case' in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Rename 'match_unix_timestamp' to 'match_any_unix_timestamp'.
            - Modify program exit message text.
            - Class 'FileObject' now gets the file type magic from
              'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Remove unused variable 'originalfilename' in 'FileObject'.

            Fixes:
            - Change how "very special case" date format in filenames are
              detected. This prevents duplicate results and is performant.
            - Improve handling filenames, especially compound extensions
              such as "filename.tar.gz" which does have the extension
              ".gz" but when dealing with "filetags" it makes more sense to
              treat all of ".tar.gz" as the extension/suffix.
            - Spell my my last name properly in 'version.py'.
              The encoding definition would allow using "ö", instead of
              the cautious "o". ..right?


2016-07-21  [autonameow v0.1.2]

            Additions:
            - Add parsing filetags from file names, as per the "filetags"
              workflow. Adds 'get_tags' to the abstract analyzer class,
              even though not all analyzer are suited to implement it.
            - Add settings related to the "filetags" workflow to the
              configuration file and default settings.
            - Start adding unit tests for 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add utility file system functions 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'diskutils.py'.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'main.py' to 'autonameow.py'.
            - Cleanup 'autonameow.py';
                - Remove unused code.
                - Rename variables and methods.
                - Make functions out of non-class specific methods.
            - Rename 'doc' directory to 'docs'.
            - Redo the unit tests completely, use different structure.
            - Add program termination message when using '--verbose'.
            - Have 'file_object' instances use the functions in 'diskutils.py'
              for getting their own filenames, etc. This makes it easier to
              test "simple" disk I/O code -- no need to create
              'file_object' instances.

            Fixes:
            - Improve matching UNIX timestamps in 'dateandtime.py'.


2016-07-11  [autonameow v0.1.1]

            Additions:
            - Log the total execution time when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Various improvements and additions to the debugging information
              provided by "logging" when running with the '--debug' option.
            - Add extra date/time search pattern to handle erroneous OCR text
              results where "/" is returned as "7".
            - Add extra date/time search pattern for filenames created by the
              Chrome extension "Full Page Screen Capture".

            Changes:
            - Change logging level for no files specified.
            - Modify logging levels. A number of 'info'-level messages are now
              'debug'-level, motivated by reducing the overall output.
            - Keyboard interrupt handling (ctrl-c) is now handled at a higer
              level so that "most" interrupts are handled properly.
            - Modify extracting date/time-information from filenames.  Adds
              search-methods and modifies the order. Still not very good and
              needs work.
            - Modify the default configuration in 'default_config.py'.
            - Modify how text is "sanitized" after extraction from documents,
              currently only pdfs. Still very broken and needs to be fixed.

            Fixes:
            - Fix pdf page numbering in debug output.
            - Fixes bug in PdfAnalyzer date/time-extraction where results from
              'dt_regex' would end up in 'text_content_brute', leading to the
              bruteforce results never reaching the results.
            - Fix cases where pdf content  extraction with PyPdf2 would return
              a single byte that counted as a successful extraction, preventing
              any additional tries/extractors from being run.


2016-07-08  [autonameow v0.1.0]
            First actual version bump. Development up until now has been at
            version v0.0.1. The code has now (barely) entered a state that
            warrants versioning.

            Additions:
            - Project now has a change log.
            - Basic alpha version of the main program, still severily lacking
              in functionality, stability and consistency.

            Changes:
            - N/A

            Fixes:
            - N/A
