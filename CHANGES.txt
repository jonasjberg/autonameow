2016-07-21  [autonameow v0.1.2]

            Additions:
            - Add parsing filetags from file names, as per the "filetags"
              workflow. Adds 'get_tags' to the abstract analyzer class,
              even though not all analyzer are suited to implement it.
            - Add settings related to the "filetags" workflow to the
              configuration file and default settings.
            - Start adding unit tests for 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add utility file system functions 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'diskutils.py'.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'main.py' to 'autonameow.py'.
            - Cleanup 'autonameow.py';
                - Remove unused code.
                - Rename variables and methods.
                - Make functions out of non-class specific methods.
            - Rename 'doc' directory to 'docs'.
            - Redo the unit tests completely, use different structure.
            - Add program termination message when using '--verbose'.
            - Have 'file_object' instances use the functions in 'diskutils.py'
              for getting their own filenames, etc. This makes it easier to
              test "simple" disk I/O code -- no need to create
              'file_object' instances.

            Fixes:
            - Improve matching UNIX timestamps in 'dateandtime.py'.


2016-07-11  [autonameow v0.1.1]

            Additions:
            - Log the total execution time when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Various improvements and additions to the debugging information
              provided by "logging" when running with the '--debug' option.
            - Add extra date/time search pattern to handle erroneous OCR text
              results where "/" is returned as "7".
            - Add extra date/time search pattern for filenames created by the
              Chrome extension "Full Page Screen Capture".

            Changes:
            - Change logging level for no files specified.
            - Modify logging levels. A number of 'info'-level messages are now
              'debug'-level, motivated by reducing the overall output.
            - Keyboard interrupt handling (ctrl-c) is now handled at a higer
              level so that "most" interrupts are handled properly.
            - Modify extracting date/time-information from filenames.  Adds
              search-methods and modifies the order. Still not very good and
              needs work.
            - Modify the default configuration in 'default_config.py'.
            - Modify how text is "sanitized" after extraction from documents,
              currently only pdfs. Still very broken and needs to be fixed.

            Fixes:
            - Fix pdf page numbering in debug output.
            - Fixes bug in PdfAnalyzer date/time-extraction where results from
              'dt_regex' would end up in 'text_content_brute', leading to the
              bruteforce results never reaching the results.
            - Fix cases where pdf content  extraction with PyPdf2 would return
              a single byte that counted as a successful extraction, preventing
              any additional tries/extractors from being run.


2016-07-08  [autonameow v0.1.0]
            First actual version bump. Development up until now has been at
            version v0.0.1. The code has now (barely) entered a state that
            warrants versioning.

            Additions:
            - Project now has a change log.
            - Basic alpha version of the main program, still severily lacking
              in functionality, stability and consistency.

            Changes:
            - N/A

            Fixes:
            - N/A
