2017-06-06  [autonameow v0.4.0]
            Final version used in the demonstration videos recorded 2017-06-06.
            Includes major changes. Refer to the Git log for in depth coverage.

              This is the first actually usable version! Still very much alpha.

            Additions:
            - Improved out printing with presets and coloring.
            - Added actual renaming of files. '--automagic' mode now
              renames files matched in the configuration file.
            - Add 'santizize_filename' from the "youtube-dl" project.
            - Various utility functions and related unit tests.
            - Add customizable date/time formats in configuration file.
            - Add parsing configuration file rules, conditions and sources.
              Parts of this still needs quite a bit of work.
            - Add 'extractor' package for content extractors that can be used
              by analyzers. Should reduce code duplication.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

            Changes:
            - Major restructuring of module hierarchy.
              All analyzers are moved to a new module 'analyzers' located at
              the same "depth" as the main 'core' module.  This is motivated
              by striving strict separation between the main program core and
              auxiliary modules that perform various tasks like data extraction
              and interaction with other systems.
            - Restructued internal data format. All crucial internal data
              structures are dervied from a reference 'RESULTS_DATA_STRUCTURE'.
            - Start move towards using callbacks to collect analyzer results.
            - Redesigned exiftool wrapper.
            - Abandon 'PyPDF' text extraction. Use 'pdftotext' exclusively.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

            Fixes:
            - Numerous fixes and corrections.
            - Documentation, bug fixes, refactoring and cleanup.

2017-05-10  [autonameow v0.3.1]
            Insignificant changes of the core functionality. But major rework
            and improvements of the testing code, documentation and structure.

            Additions:
            - Include additional information on the environment in debug mode.
            - Add new option '--config-path' to allow specifying an alternative
              configuration file to use instead of the default configuration
              file at predetermined platform-specific locations.
            - Add shared library for the integration test scripts;
              'tests/integration_utils.sh', contains common utility functions
              used by bash test-scripts, like assertions, execution time
              measurement, logging, etc.
            - Add integration tests and integration test runner;
                - Add main integration runner 'integration_runner.sh'.
                - Add "Test Suite" test suite 'integration_test_tests.sh'.
                - Add "Command-Line Interface" test suite
                  'integration_test_cli.sh'.
                - Add "Documentation" test suite 'integration_test_docs.sh'.
            - Add directory 'devscripts' for developer tools and scripts.
                - Add experimental script 'list-imported-modules.sh'.

              Handles setting up paths and global variables that are exported
              to the environment.
            - Add unit test runner; 'unit_runner.py'.
              Wraps 'pytest' which is used to run all unit tests and export the
              test results report to a HTML file.
            - Add (work in progress) runner for ALL tests; 'common_runner.sh'.
              This script will run both integration tests and unit tests and
              produce a summary report which will be included in the project
              wiki page, alternatively uploaded to GitHub pages.

            Changes:
            - Remove matching of rule field 'filename_in_filetags_format'
              in 'RuleMatcher'. Motivation is limiting project scope.
            - Remove prototype integration test; 'tests/run_integration_1.sh'.

            Fixes:
            - Various fixes and corrections to the main source and unit tests.
            - Various fixes and corrections to the utility scripts.

            - Add simple handling of NotImplementedError exceptions thrown in
              the abstract analyzer base class when an unimplemented field
              attribute getter is called.
            - Fixed various failing unit tests.


2016-12-19  [autonameow v0.2.2]

            Additions:
            - Include exiftool wrapper 'pyexiftool'.
                  http://smarnach.github.com/pyexiftool
                  https://github.com/smarnach/pyexiftool
              Simply copied in place for now. Dependecies should be handled
              properly, as git submodules, via pip or similar mechanism.
            - Add wrapper script 'run.sh' to act as a main entry point.
            - Start using exiftool in the pdf analyser.

                - Operating mode is either "automagic" or "interactive".
                  Default mode is the (safer (?)) "interactive mode".
                - Options for which actions to perform, for example:
                  "prepend datetime" or "rename" (unimplemented) are separate.
            - Add simpler method for getting fields from analyzers.
            - Change main color in the ASCII art header from yellow to blue.
            - Various changes to the 'namebuilder' class. Still far from done.

            - Fix bug where the message to use '--help' to display help was
              displayed even when '--help' was used.
            - Display  message if the yet unimplemented feature "prepend
              datetime" is enabled.
            - Fix bug in 'prettyprint_options' by explicitly wrapping

            Additions:
            - Improved inline documentation/docstrings.
            - Add priority to the analysis run queue execution.
                - Analyzers are assigned a priority number 0-1, stored in the
                  class variable 'run_queue_priority'.
                - Analysis with a higher number are executed before those
                  with a lower number.
            - Add rule field 'prefer_title'.
              Specifies which title to use, similar to 'prefer_datetime'.
            - Add detecting filename in "filetags" format.
                - Add method 'filetags_format_filename()' to 'FileObject' that
                  returns boolean True if the filename is in "filetags" format.
                - Add unit tests for 'filetags_format_filename()'.
            - Add rules to 'config_defaults.py' for testing.
            - Add matching of rule field 'filename_in_filetags_format' in
              'RuleMatcher'.

            Fixes:
            - Fix error caused by missing 'string.letters' attribute with
              Python 3. Use 'ascii_letters' for now. Should be fixed.
            - Fix broken unit tests.
            - PIL exception logging debug message caused crash.
            - Fix guessit import statement.

2016-08-28  [autonameow v0.2.0]

            Additions:
            - N/A

            Changes:
            - Migrate project to Python 3.5.
              Drop Python 2 support entirely for simplicity.
              Backwards compatibility fixes might be added at some future time.

              version "2to3-2.7 2.7 January 2012". Some passed unchanged.

            Fixes:
            - N/A


2016-08-19  [autonameow v0.1.8]

            Additions:
            - Add unit tests for 'options.py'.
            - Add a 'NameBuilder' class for assembling new names.
              Fills out the empty template specified by a matching rule with
              data from analysis results.
            - Extend and improve the 'RuleMatcher'.
            - Add dynamic listing of Analyzer classes.
                - Store all analyzer classes in '_ALL_ANALYZER_CLASSES'.
                  The classes are added if their name ends with "Analyzer".
                - Adds function 'get_analyzer_classes' to access the above list.
                - Adds function 'get_instantiated_analyzers' to get a list of
                  analyzer objects.
                  Note that these are instantiated with a None 'FileObject'.
            - Store relevant file mime types in the analyzers themselves.  Add
              a new field 'applies_to_mime' that can be a string, a list of
              strings or None, which means the analyzer should be used
              regardless of file mimetype.

            Changes:
            - Rename the command-line option '--ignore-before-year' to
              '--ignore-to-year'.

            - Improve function 'arg_is_year'.
            - Remove stub "action" classes 'AbstractAction' and 'RenameAction'.
            - Do not pass filter instances to the analyzers.  Filters were not
              used anyway, instead do the filtering as a separate step after
              the analysis.
            - Analyzers do not execute their analysis at instantiation.
                - Use new method 'run()' to start the analysis.

            Fixes:
            - Fix incorrect number of arguments expected for options
              '--ignore-from-year', '--ignore-years' and '--ignore-to-year'.
            - Rule matcher name regex tests file basename.
            - Fix no matching rule caused crash.

            - Extend the "filename partitioning" to include a date-/timestamp.
              Add and/or modify unit tests for extracting 'filenamepart_ts'.

            Changes:
            - Remove the 'Results' class in 'analysis.py' and substitute a
              plain dictionary instead.
            - Rename the actual value key in the results dictionary returned by
              analyzers to "value", instead of the previous "datetime" and
              "title" for datetime and title respectively.

              attribute names and structure.
            - Update how the 'FilenameAnalyzer' gets tags from filenames.
              Now uses the "partitioned filename" methods in 'FileObject'.


2016-07-22  [autonameow v0.1.3]

            Additions:
            - Add a very fancy ASCII art logo, created with "figlet".
              Displayed only when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Add tests for functions in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Move function 'filetype_magic' to the utility file system
              functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Move responsability for basic file name operations to the utility
              file system functions in 'diskutils.py'.
                - Tests for getting file name extensions, file basename, etc.
            - Tests for extracting "filetags" tags.

            Changes:
            - Modify startup "banner" text contents and overall appearance.
            - Improve 'match_special_case' in 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Rename 'match_unix_timestamp' to 'match_any_unix_timestamp'.
            - Modify program exit message text.
            - Class 'FileObject' now gets the file type magic from
              'filetype_magic' in 'diskutils.py'.
            - Remove unused variable 'originalfilename' in 'FileObject'.

            Fixes:
            - Change how "very special case" date format in filenames are
              detected. This prevents duplicate results and is performant.
            - Improve handling filenames, especially compound extensions
              such as "filename.tar.gz" which does have the extension
              ".gz" but when dealing with "filetags" it makes more sense to
              treat all of ".tar.gz" as the extension/suffix.
            - Spell my my last name properly in 'version.py'.
              The encoding definition would allow using "ö", instead of
              the cautious "o". ..right?


2016-07-21  [autonameow v0.1.2]

            Additions:
            - Add parsing filetags from file names, as per the "filetags"
              workflow. Adds 'get_tags' to the abstract analyzer class,
              even though not all analyzer are suited to implement it.
            - Add settings related to the "filetags" workflow to the
              configuration file and default settings.
            - Start adding unit tests for 'dateandtime.py'.
            - Add utility file system functions 'diskutils.py'.
                - Add tests for 'diskutils.py'.

            Changes:
            - Rename 'main.py' to 'autonameow.py'.
            - Cleanup 'autonameow.py';
                - Remove unused code.
                - Rename variables and methods.
                - Make functions out of non-class specific methods.
            - Rename 'doc' directory to 'docs'.
            - Redo the unit tests completely, use different structure.
            - Add program termination message when using '--verbose'.
            - Have 'file_object' instances use the functions in 'diskutils.py'
              for getting their own filenames, etc. This makes it easier to
              test "simple" disk I/O code -- no need to create
              'file_object' instances.

            Fixes:
            - Improve matching UNIX timestamps in 'dateandtime.py'.


2016-07-11  [autonameow v0.1.1]

            Additions:
            - Log the total execution time when using the '--verbose' option.
            - Various improvements and additions to the debugging information
              provided by "logging" when running with the '--debug' option.
            - Add extra date/time search pattern to handle erroneous OCR text
              results where "/" is returned as "7".
            - Add extra date/time search pattern for filenames created by the
              Chrome extension "Full Page Screen Capture".

            Changes:
            - Change logging level for no files specified.
            - Modify logging levels. A number of 'info'-level messages are now
              'debug'-level, motivated by reducing the overall output.
            - Keyboard interrupt handling (ctrl-c) is now handled at a higer
              level so that "most" interrupts are handled properly.
            - Modify extracting date/time-information from filenames.  Adds
              search-methods and modifies the order. Still not very good and
              needs work.
            - Modify the default configuration in 'default_config.py'.
            - Modify how text is "sanitized" after extraction from documents,
              currently only pdfs. Still very broken and needs to be fixed.

            Fixes:
            - Fix pdf page numbering in debug output.
            - Fixes bug in PdfAnalyzer date/time-extraction where results from
              'dt_regex' would end up in 'text_content_brute', leading to the
              bruteforce results never reaching the results.
            - Fix cases where pdf content  extraction with PyPdf2 would return
              a single byte that counted as a successful extraction, preventing
              any additional tries/extractors from being run.


2016-07-08  [autonameow v0.1.0]
            First actual version bump. Development up until now has been at
            version v0.0.1. The code has now (barely) entered a state that
            warrants versioning.

            Additions:
            - Project now has a change log.
            - Basic alpha version of the main program, still severily lacking
              in functionality, stability and consistency.

            Changes:
            - N/A

            Fixes:
            - N/A
