>       gathered during the first run.

### 2017-11-29

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0066]` __Fix bad encoding of bytestring paths when listing results.__  
>   When listing results with any of the `--list-*` options, paths are not
>   displayed properly due to them not being handled properly before being passed
>   to `yaml.dump` which performs the formatting of the results dict.

### 2017-11-28

### 2017-11-10

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0122]` __Move away from using callbacks to return analyzer results.__  
>   Using callbacks to pass data back from the analyzers do not currently
>   provide any benefits but is a lot more difficult to read and test than
>   just simply returning the data directly, as the extractors do.
>
> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0120]` Use less verbose default output in the regression test runner.

### 2017-11-07

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0117]` Implement automated regression testing.

### 2017-10-29

> Medium Priority

>
> * `[TD0116]` Remove persistent caching in the text extractors.

### 2017-10-21

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0105]` Integrate the `MeowURI` class.

### 2017-10-11

> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0017]` Rethink how specified sources are connected to actual sources.
>   Take for example the configuration rule:
>
>     ```yaml
>     RULES:
>     -   CONDITIONS:
>             contents:
>                 mime_type: image/*
>             filesystem:
>                 pathname: ~/Dropbox/Camera Uploads/.*
>         DATA_SOURCES:
>             extension: contents.mime_type
>     ```
>   This will fail, or *should fail* as MIME types on the form `image/jpeg`,
>   `image/png`, etc can't be used as a file extension without some
>   pre-processing -- converting `image/png` to `png`.
>
> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0039]` Do not include the rule attribute `score` when listing the
>   configuration with `--dump-config`.
>
> * `[TD0038]` Add new name format placeholder field `{year}`.

### 2017-10-10

> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0097]` Improve and fully implement caching to files on disk.

### 2017-10-07

> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0098]` Use checksums as keys for cached data, not paths.

### 2017-10-06

> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0103]` Handle duplicate metadata results from different ISBNs.

### 2017-10-05

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0044]` __Rework converting "raw data" to internal representations__
>     * Converting raw data to internal representations is currently implemented
>       very poorly and must be reworked.
>     * Think about how to handle translation in the "general" sense; high-level,
>       abstract. Would it be wise to let data extractors convert raw data to
>       internal types? (For example; messy OCR text to `datetime` object)
>         * A "general solution" using some new entity tasked with translating
>           data *might be too "general"* considering the likely granularity of
>           operations needed to perform the conversion.  That is, if the
>           required operations differs greatly between data sources, abstracting
>           the process would mostly add yet another layer of indirection ..
>     * Think about how wrapped data types (`[TD0002]`) relates to this.
>
> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0070]` Implement arbitrary common personal use case.

### 2017-09-29

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0012]` Add some type of caching.
>     * Extracting text from a PDF should only have to happen once, at most.
>       Preferably not at all, unless a rule conditional tests the text content
>       or the text is needed elsewhere.
>     * Image OCR is very slow, should only be executed when needed, caching the
>       results for all accesses.
>
> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0023]` Add additional option to force non-interactive mode (`--batch`?)
>
> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0042]` Respect the `--quiet` option. Suppress (all but critical?) output.

### 2017-09-28

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0090]` Complete initial implementation of "generic" data fields.

### 2017-09-27

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0004]` __Text encoding issues__
>     * Enforce strict boundaries between all external systems and an internal
>       text data representation.
>     * Store original filename parts as both bytestrings and the internal
>       representation?  If the user wants to use a part of the original file
>       name in the result, the conversion can not be lossy. Best way to prevent
>       issues is to store bytestrings and perform any processing on copies that
>       have __not__ been converted to the internal format?
>
> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0062]` Look at testing that all name template fields are mapped to data
>   sources. This could be done when reading the configuration, instead of later
>   on in the name builder.
>
> * `[TD0049]` __Think about defining legal "placeholder fields".__
>   Might be helpful to define all legal fields (such as `title`, `datetime`,
>   `author`, etc.) somewhere and keep references to type coercion wrappers,
>   maybe validation and/or formatting functionality; in the field definitions.
>
> * `[TD0018]` There are more cases like the above that should be thought about.
>   A common case is the slight modification to the current file name.
>   Original file name:
>     ```
>     2017-06-20_00-49-56 Working on autonameow.png
>     ```
>   Desired file name:
>     ```
>     2017-06-20T004956 Working on autonameow.png
>     ```
>   How should this be specified in the configuration?
>   A simple alternative is to specify the filename analyzer as the source.
>   The `DATETIME_FORMAT` makes sure that the timestamp format is changed.
>
>     ```yaml
>     RULES:
>     -   DATA_SOURCES:
>             extension: contents.basename.extension
>             datetime: analysis.filename.{?????}
>             title: filesystem.basename.prefix
>         NAME_FORMAT: "{datetime} {title}.{extension}"
>     DATETIME_FORMAT:
>         datetime: '%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S'
>     ```
>   But this is not configurable -- how would the filename analyzer know
>   which of many possible datetime results to use?

### 2017-09-25

> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0086]` __Use one `SessionRepository` per `Autonameow` instance.__  
>   The `Autonameow` class "manages a running instance of the program" should
>   have its own instance of the `Repository` class. This is fine for now but
>   should be fixed to avoid confusion and future problems.

### 2017-09-22

> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0081]` Bundle the `pyexiftool` dependency. Add to `autonameow/thirdparty`.

### 2017-09-20

### 2017-09-17

> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0083]` __Clean up the type wrapper classes.__  
>     * Remove ambiguities around returning "NULL" and raising `AWTypeError`.
>     * Clean up the "interface" to the type wrappers. If callers only use the
>       shared singleton module attributes, I.E. all data flows in through
>       `__call__`, then unit testing the `coerce` method is superfluous.
>     * Look at the `normalize` methods, think about removing them if they
>       continue to go unused.  See also, related entry: `[TD0060]`

### 2017-09-14

> Low Priority
> ------------
>
> * `[TD0060]` Implement or remove the type wrapper classes `format` method.

### 2017-09-11

### 2017-08-25

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0080]` __Fix literal strings not considered a valid "data source".__  
>   It is currently not possible to specify a fixed literal value for a name
>   template field. Take the following example rule;

>     ```yaml
>   -   CONDITIONS:
>             filesystem.basename.full: 'P[0-9]{7}.JPG'
>             filesystem.contents.mime_type: image/jpeg

>             extension: jpg
>         NAME_FORMAT: '{datetime}.{extension}'
>     ```
>
>   This rule will not pass validation because the literal string `jpg` is
>   discarded by the `is_valid_source` function in `core/config/rules.py`;

### 2017-08-23

> High Priority
> -------------
>
> * `[TD0076]` __Have all non-core components register themselves at startup.__  
>   A lot of the problems with implementing a plugin-interface, handling queries
>   from components to a centralized "data pool", only running the required
>   plugins/extractors/analyzers for performance, etc; might possibly be solved
>   by implementing a more sophisticated method of keeping track of available
>   components.
>     * Enumerate all available extractors, analyzers and plugins at startup.
>         * Check that dependencies are available; external executables, etc.
>         * Have the components "register" their "meowURIs". If the component
>           could return data with "meowURI"
>           `metadata.exiftool.PDF:CreateDate`, register the first part:
>           `metadata.exiftool`.
>     * Read the configuration file and get a list of all referenced "meowURIs".
>     * Find out which components could produce the referenced "meowURIs" and

>       required.
>
> Medium Priority
> ---------------
>
> * `[TD0056]` __Determine which extractors should be used for each input.__  
>   In order to add conditional data extraction, a list of relevant extractors
>   must be produced for each input path that will be processed. This should
>   probably be collected during configuration parsing and rule matching; if a
>   rule needs some information to be evaluated, the relevant extractor must
>   be enqueued and executed.
>
> * `[TD0057]` __Look at the optional `field` parameter of the `query` method.__  
>   The extractor classes `query` method takes an optional parameter `field` that
>   seems to be unused. Some classes, like the text extractors will probably not

> * __The `Extraction` class controls all extractors__ --
>   The first step in the processing pipeline is calling the extractors that are
>   relevant to the current file.
>     * Data produced by `extractor` classes is returned to a new separate
>       container class `ExtractedData`.
> * __The `Analysis` class controls all analyzers__ --
>   Extracted data from `ExtractedData` is passed to the `Analysis` instance at
>   init.  Then the analyzers relevant to the file is called to process the data
>   returned by the extractors.
>
> ### Internal data storage
>
> * Think about distinguishing between *simple static data* and *derived data*.
>     * __"Static data":__ string `test.pdf`
>       (stored in results query field `filesystem.basename.full`)
>     * __"Derived data":__ `datetime`-object extracted from a UNIX timestamp
>       in `filesystem.basename.full`. Possibly stored as a dictionary with
>       the `datetile`-object in `data['value']`, along with `weight`, etc.
>     * Possibly additional types?
> * Should the "simple static" information be collected in a separate run?
> * Should the `Analysis` class `Results` instance only contain "simple static"
>   data? If so, use a separate container for "derived data".
> * Alternatively, store all types of results in the `Analysis` class `Results`
>   instance but modify the `Results` class to distinguish between the types?
